					<description><![CDATA[Wow! These are some pretty cool and practical tips one can use for saving energy in the kitchen. Thanks a lot for sharing this :D. One tip that could&#039;ve potentially made the list is the installation of a home energy monitoring device in your home. These devices allow you to monitor the power consumption of all your devices and are quite affordable. We were a bit skeptical at first as well but we got one called Ohm Assistant eventually and it has been working like a charm!]]></description>

Dumpheating- while boiling/cooking, you can heat other stuff with the steam by  placing  content on top as cover rather than covering with lid,assuming equal amounts of content,the top content achieves boiling point faster]]></description>
