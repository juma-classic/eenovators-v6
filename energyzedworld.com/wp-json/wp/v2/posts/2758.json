In today&#8217;s blog post I will take you through these various factors that will determine how much you will spend on an installation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Home&#8217;s Energy Use<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The electricity demand of your home will determine the size of Solar Pv to be installed. The bigger the demand the bigger the PV system which means you will have to pay more and vise versa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A house that has appliances such as water heater, stove, air conditioner and heater, washing machine and clothes dryer, gaming systems, computers and home entertainment systems, will have a higher demand of electricity therefore will have to pay more to have a bigger solar PV system that can feed all the needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you are not planing to be completely dependent on Solar PV the grid can be fed into some of the lines that consume more electricity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Model of Solar Panel<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The different models of solar panels are priced differently and therefore this is also a factor that will determine how much the overall cost of installation will be. As of today there are only three types of solar panels, namely:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Monocrystalline cells solar<\/li><li>Polycrystalline cells solar<\/li><li>Thin film solar<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Solar Incentives<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you live in a state where there are incentives for residential houses Solar PV installations then you are lucky as this be a positive factor. You will pay less for an installation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Environmental Conditions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If your locality is mostly cloudy you might need to invest on a larger Solar PV system to avoid shortages in power supply. You may need more solar panels mounted on the roof. This will also determine the amount of money you spend on a Solar PV installation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Installation Related Costs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To mount solar panels on the roof you will need racks and these will add to the cost of installation. You will also need to pay labor costs to the installer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the solar panels to work you will need other accessories such as an inverter and batteries which will again add to the cost of installation. There may also be additional costs for instance transport charges, local permit fees (where applicable), inspection fees and taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choice of Installer<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to Solar PV systems installations it is very important that you only contract qualified personnel to do the job. Hire someone who knows what they are doing to avoid losses or any unnecessary additional costs on the installation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you are aware of the factors that will affect how much you spend on a Solar PV system, you are good to go. To know the exact price of an installation, you need to contact a qualified installer for sizing and quotation.
