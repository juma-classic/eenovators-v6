Ozone cutting\/checking is a series of interlacing cracks produced\nby the action of ozone on rubber under mechanical stress. If the gloves are used\nin an environment where the levels of ozone are high due to pollution, ozone\nresistance is critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the electrical safety gloves have been purchased, OSHA\nrequires that \u201cprotective equipment be maintained in a safe, reliable\ncondition.\u201d This requires that the gloves be inspected for any damage before\neach day\u2019s use. Gloves must also be inspected immediately following any\nincident suspected to have caused damage. OSHA also requires that insulating\ngloves be given an air test along with the inspection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the daily inspection, OSHA requires\nelectrical safety equipment to be tested regularly. Rubber insulating gloves\nmust be tested before first issue and every six months thereafter. They\nshould be inspected for tears, holes, ozone cuts, swelling which is generally\ncaused by chemical contaminants and any other defect. The testing is supposed\nto be done by OSHA accredited labs. If the\ninsulating gloves have been electrically tested but not issued for service,\nthey may not be placed into service unless they have been electrically tested\nwithin the previous 12 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help ensure the\nintegrity of the gloves and worker safety, gloves need to be stored properly\nwhen not in use. Proper storage means that gloves must not be folded and need\nto be kept out of excessive heat, sunlight, humidity, ozone and any chemical or\nsubstance that could damage the rubber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>DO\u2019S &amp; DON\u2019TS<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>DO:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Follow company work procedures and safety rules <\/li><li>Inspect gloves daily for damage <\/li><li>Wear proper leather protectors over rubber\ngloves<\/li><li>Wash gloves with mild soap and rinse thoroughly\nwith water <\/li><li>Let gloves air dry at room temperature or less\nthan 120\u00b0 F (49\u00b0 C) <\/li><li>Store\ngloves in a protective bag<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>DON\u2019T:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Wear jewelry or sharp objects when using rubber\ngloves <\/li><li>Wear damaged gloves <\/li><li>Store gloves inside out, folded, or ways causing\nstretching or compression<\/li><li>Store gloves near sources of UV, Ozone or heat<\/li><li>Allow gloves to contact petroleum-based products\n(oil, gas, solvent, hand creams)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grainger.com\/content\/qt-electrical-safety-gloves-inspection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">https:\/\/www.grainger.com\/content\/qt-electrical-safety-gloves-inspection<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.magidglove.com\/electrical-gloves-buying-guide.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">https:\/\/www.magidglove.com\/electrical-gloves-buying-guide.aspx<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grainger.com\/know-how\/safety\/ppe-in-the-workplace\/hand-protection\/kh-electrical-gloves-5-things-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">https:\/\/www.grainger.com\/know-how\/safety\/ppe-in-the-workplace\/hand-protection\/kh-electrical-gloves-5-things-to-know<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/api.ferguson.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">https:\/\/api.ferguson.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-1103890540\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Monica Ngage Every day we wake up and go on with our daily hustles.
