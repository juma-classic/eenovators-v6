Elizabeth Rogo, who is the Founder and CEO of  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tsavooilfieldservices.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tsavo Oilfield Services<\/a>, as the Chamber&#8217;s president for East Africa. She is based in Nairobi and will represent the Chamber across East African countries, namely; Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda and South Sudan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt is an honor for me to be joining the African Energy Chamber and to give a stronger voice and representation to Kenya and the whole of East Africa in the global energy scene,\u201d Elizabeth Rogo said. \u201cThere is a lot to be done in our region when it comes to local content development across the value-chain and the adoption of the right policies to promote investment. I look forward to my work with the <a href=\"https:\/\/energychamber.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">African Energy Chamber<\/a> and to further contribute to the growth of our energy industry in the region,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This appointment comes at a very convenient time when the energy markets in Africa are in dire need of leadership to promote unity and the continuity of operations across all the sectors, with oil prices crash and economies affected greatly by the lock-downs across and beyond. Elizabeth&#8217;s role will also represent the continuity of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/energychamber.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">African Energy Chamber<\/a> across the continent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> East Africa is an area of great potential and with proper leadership and guidance in the energy sector, rapid economic growth will be experienced. For instance South Sudan is a well established oil producer while Kenya and Uganda are still growing. On the other hand, Tanzania is key promoter of gas to power projects and strategies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elizabeth as the president will be ensuring the success of developmental activities such as development of local content and building domestic capacity, promoting women in the energy sector, supporting entrepreneurship across East Africa, advocating for policy reforms and ease of doing business and promoting investments in oil, gas and the power industry at large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe could not be more delighted with this appointment,\u201d declared NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman at the <a href=\"https:\/\/energychamber.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">African Energy Chamber<\/a>. \u201cElizabeth is a representation of African entrepreneurship in the sector and a true expert when it comes to East Africa and local content development. She is an inspiration for many young women in our industry, and a true pan-Africanist. She will head our activities in East Africa at a time when the region\u2019s energy industry is entering a new era of growth and diversification and we look forward to her journey with us,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-3384511766\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Ruth Carol Atieno The African Energy Chamber has appointed Eng.
