The need to<br \/>\nput solar water heating as a centralfocus of attention stems from various interventions in the past five<br \/>\nyears that although have created awareness and uptake, still need joint efforts to hit the nationwide<br \/>\nrenewable energy targets.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the need to harness industry knowledge from key renewable energy expert Mr. Eric<br \/>\nHawkins with vast renewable energy qualifications and business interests in three continents played<br \/>\na key role in constituting this forum for discussion. Mr. Hawkins who hails from the UK and has been<br \/>\ninvolved in the design of state-of-the-art solar energy hot water systems, energy storage tanks, and<br \/>\nsolar energy knowledge transfer. As the key facilitator, the workshop tapped into his insights on solar<br \/>\nsystem design, installation and maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the Energy (Solar Water Heating) Regulations 2012 requiring all premises with hot<br \/>\nwater requirements exceeding 100 litres per day to have solar water heating panels, discussions have<br \/>\nbeen rife on how to regulate, improve and capitalize on these opportunities as solar practitioners.<br \/>\nThe workshop sought create and invigorating space for these discussions amongst different industry<br \/>\nplayers and to share knowledge with a view to yielding sustainable next steps.<\/p>\n<p>The Energy Regulatory Commission, indicates that an estimated 4 million households need<br \/>\ninstallation of the Solar Hot Water heating systems in Kenya. This compared against the 160 licensed<br \/>\nprofessionals who can carry out the installations is very limited in terms of capacity to deliver. The<br \/>\nneed for sensitization to increase professional uptake vide the valid certification process, in order to<br \/>\nenhance the human resource capacity for solar installations requires prioritisation. This workshop<br \/>\nwas aimed at stimulating key stakeholders to be involved in building capacity as the country moves<br \/>\ntowards embracing renewable energy and towards meeting the global energy goals.<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-1381097452\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[wpdm_package id=&#8217;2029&#8242;] The solar hot water workshop was conceptualized owing to the need to bring stakeholders in the solar hot water industry together to discuss the various issues affecting the industry and to map the way forward for a sustainable future given the current operating environment in the region.
