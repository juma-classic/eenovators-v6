MANYALA<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fun fact<\/strong>: Did you know that the sun supplies more energy to earth in one hour than humanity uses in an entire year? About 1,366 watts of direct solar radiation per square meter is received by the earth while 173,000 terawatts of solar energy continuously impacting the earth\u2019s surface. This is 10,000 times more than the world\u2019s overall energy use. The first silicon solar cell was developed by Bell laboratories in 1954 as a precursor for all solar-powered devices? Solar energy is not only clean and renewable but the most abundant form of energy which is becoming more popular with businesses and homeowners due to its economical advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"276\" height=\"183\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2967 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 276px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 276\/183;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does a  Solar PV Work? <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Solar PV (Photovoltaic) directly absorbs energy from the sun while converting it into electricity. Protons found in the sun\u2019s rays strike the solar module which contains electrons that move to create electrical currents. \u00a0Having both grid connection and net metering, you can benefit from surplus production days and prolong your solar energy use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clean Energy! <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Transforming sunlight into usable power is crucial at a time when global warming (gradual heating of the earth\u2019s climate system) is creating a shift in weather patterns which impact on agriculture, wildlife, sea levels, air pollution and severe weather. Current economic globalization trends are keen towards sustainable technology and practices that progress innovations while conserving natural resources to maintain ecological balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solar energy is an effective and efficient source of energy because; it requires low maintenance, it is renewable, and abundant. Solar energy is non-polluting to the environment because it is clean energy. Also, it increases the value of homes and businesses because it reduces utility bills by up to 90% due to low electricity expenses. Solar energy use has increased up to 3000% over the years including an output of approximately 100 gigawatts total solar capacity within one decade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"235\" height=\"235\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2968 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/3.jpg 235w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/3-150x150.jpg 150w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 235px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 235\/235;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoiding power outage!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rooftop solar panels are attainable and can save your power bill at any income level.
