Kenya expects peak demand to top 22,000 megawatts by 2031, partly\u00a0because of\u00a0industrial expansion, a component in Kenyatta\u2019s Big Four Agenda.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also indicated that the  nuclear agency is now assessing technologies to identify\u00a0the perfect\u00a0reactor for the country and a  site in Tana River County, near the Kenyan coast was preferred after studies across three regions. The plant\u00a0will be \u00a0developed with a concessionaire under a build, operate and transfer model.<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-1600208072\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Ruth Carol Atieno Is Kenya going nuclear?
