Water must be conserved and this can be achieved by conducting a water audit to identify areas of water wastage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Conducting a Water Audit.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Conducting a water audit comes with advantages and I will take you through them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Be Aware of Your Water Usage<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The very first benefit of water auditing is that it will help you be aware of your water usage. And through this you will then be able to come up with conservation measures that are best suited for your water usage pattern or process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Preservation of Water Supply<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>For instances where one water source is shared by many, a water audit process will help in the conservation of the water supplied. The same will also apply when the water source is not shared. Areas of wastage can be easily identified and conservation measures put in place during a water auditing process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Reduced Water Bills<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>After conducting a water audit and implementation of all the recommended  water conservation measures, you only get to pay for what you use. This means reduced monthly water bills since no water will be wasted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Know The Quality of Water<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to quantity, the quality of water used can also be identified during a water auditing process. This is a health related matter and therefore it is very important to understand the quality of water used in different process, for instance in a food processing plant or even at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Development of Water Storage Structures<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Through water auditing a state is able to understand the water cycle and therefore can easily come up with the appropriate water storage structures such as dams, bunds, lakes etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Identify Critical Areas<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Areas that need immediate attention can be easily identified and attended to only when a water auditing is conducted. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Compliance<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>In some states it is mandatory to conduct water auditing. Conducting water auditing helps you adhere to the rules and regulations therefore being compliant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Conduct A Water Audit<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To conduct a successful water audit you will need to contract a qualified and certified water auditor.
