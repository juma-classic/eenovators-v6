Unnecessary\u00a0 energy consumption is drastically reduced as one can track the consumption constantly. This will in turn reduce wastage thus reducing cost.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enegy efficiency and sustainability is increased \u2013 As energy Management focuses on energy efficiency through the implementation of energy conservation measures, the processes and equipment are optimised to attain goals with less energy. This leads to sustainability and reduces environmental impact.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reduction of carbon emissions\u00a0 &#8211; with the reduction of energy consumption and otimization of equipment and processes with energy efficient methods, the CO2 emissions are reduced. This contributes to the mitigation of climate change.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhancing \u00a0the reliance of energy systems \u2013 having an energy managemnet system in place ensures there is constant effective maintenance, sufficient power back up solutions and optimizes energy distribution. This minimizes power outages .<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improve on financial planning \u2013 energy management through the use of enegy management systems can help in tracking and understanding enegy usage patter.s, this way individuals and companies can accurately forecast energy and budget for energy expenses.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reduces maintenance cost \u2013 the enegy management helps in understanding enegy usage patterns. Therefore , maintenance issues are handled on timely basis. This prevents costly breakdown, unplanned downtime and equipment failure.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optimizes resource allocation and utilisation- through power usage analyses trends individuals and companies can use the trends to recommend and implement energy efficient equipment and tools by optimizing their resource allocation thus reducing wastage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compliance with energy regulations and standards- Energy management ensure that facilities are up to date with energy regulations, the implementation of energy conservation measures are put in place within a designated period.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhances renewable energy integration \u2013 Energy Management facilitates the integration of renewable energy sources into existing renewable systems.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhances equipment reliability and lifespan- proactive energy management ensures regular maintenance of equipment and optimum efficiency in operation. This is in turn ascertain that all energy related issues are handled promptly avoiding impromptu breakdowns of equipment.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-1006647129\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Loise Anono What is Energy Management The appropriate use of energy without interfering with normal services and production.
