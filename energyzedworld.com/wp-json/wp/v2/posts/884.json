I own lots of different equipment and accessories that consume so much energy &nbsp;including; Cooker, microwave, a kettle, blender, fridge, Television, home theater, washing machine, iron box, a water heater geyser-for boiling water for use in the bathroom, and more than 20 bulbs. In a Kenyan home, with all this accessories and equipment electricity spend cannot be less than Kshs 4000 per month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is &#8211; Do I spend this much on my monthly electricity bill? NO I spend at most Kshs 1500 per month\u2026.only!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What have we done and what can be done?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lighting<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>First most important thing we did was to buy LED lights for the whole house i.e. about 21 bulbs! Despite the expense incurred in buying them, we spend less on electricity-it is actually paying back! We also ensure than we use the natural light as much as possible and turning off lights when not in use. There are different types of light bulbs i.e. LED, CFL and Incandescent with LED being the most effective in energy saving and Incandescent most inefficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By buying energy efficient bulbs and making use of the day light, you reduce your electricity bill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-885 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/1.jpg 540w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/1-300x225.jpg 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 540px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 540\/405;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Figure 1: Comparison of different light bulbs<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Water heating<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Water heating is a great contributor to high electricity bills especially when using a water heater geyser. We used to have and our electricity bills were so high. By installing a solar water heater we were able to cut this to almost zero and we only heat water using electricity during cold and cloudy seasons, which is very rare in our locality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using the right water heaters, opting for renewable energy solutions and also using less water e.g. by spending less time in the bathroom helps you save energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Appliances and electronics<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As earlier indicated, we have a host of appliances and electronics that consume energy. For this we chose to have energy efficient appliances. How does someone know an energy efficient appliance\/electronic? Look for an energy star logo or energy rating of the appliance when buying it at the shop and save your money by reducing your energy consumption. This also helps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"284\" height=\"174\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-886 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 284px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 284\/174;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Figure 2: How to check for an energy efficient appliance-Green being the more efficient<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Renewable energy<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes use of Solar as a source of energy.
