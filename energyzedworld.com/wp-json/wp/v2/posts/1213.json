Kenya is now generating more electricity using diesel. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are keen enough, you will notice your electricity bill has been slowly increasing. Take a look at specifically the month of May, the cost of fuel has increased drastically. And this is because the cheaper hydropower is not enough to sustain the electricity demand in Kenya.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The rise of fuel cost levy<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The fuel cost levy which was previously Sh.2.75, rose up to Sh.3.75 per Kilowatt hour. The Energy Principal Secretary, Joseph Njoroge, explained that the fuel cost charge has gone up due to the prolonged drought that the country has gone through recently. He also added that the situation would have been worse if we had no intervention from wind power, we would have experienced the highest ever fuel cost charge coupled with some power rationing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"890\" height=\"445\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ps.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1217 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ps.jpg 890w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ps-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ps-768x384.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 890px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 890\/445;\" \/><figcaption> <br>Energy Principal Secretary, Joseph Njoroge <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Sh.3.75 charge already took effect, on Friday 10<sup>th<\/sup>, for the consumers using the prepaid system. As for the consumers using postpaid, they are yet to feel the punch from June. This means that homes and businesses, on a monthly average, will have to pay an additional whooping Sh930 million in fuel costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> EPRA yet to release April data and  there is no hope for any good news. Clearly, since the rainfall patterns are not pleasing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our hope now is on the two largest clean energy sources in Kenya, Lake Turkana Wind Power which has a capacity of 850 Kilowatt hours and the 50 Megawatt Garissa Solar Power Plant, from which the government has promised increased generation of cheaper electricity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Garissa-Solar-plant-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1215 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Garissa-Solar-plant-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Garissa-Solar-plant-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Garissa-Solar-plant-768x431.jpg 768w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Garissa-Solar-plant.jpg 1200w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/575;\" \/><figcaption>Garissa Solar Power Plant<br><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/1111.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1216 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/1111.jpg 800w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/1111-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/1111-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 800px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 800\/600;\" \/><figcaption>Lake Turkana Wind Power <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-2675052683\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Ruth Carol Atieno Electricity prices shoots up again Kenya, for quite a long time, has been hit by a dry spell and this year, the rains came later than expected.
