It was introduced to help the utility provider offer more accurate billing services to its customers. Previously, there were cases of energy consumption data not being read accurately by Kenya Power Staff, resulting in unfair billing.

(<em>This is significantly below the value of 0.9 recommended by KPLC)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This implies that there is a significant \u201cwastage\u201d of electricity.&nbsp; (You are drawing more power from the grid than you actually need to run your machinery).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these trends are to persist, your facility might end up incurring a penalty from KPLC on your bill. (The penalty will be in the form of a \u201cPower Factor Surcharge\u201d on your monthly KPLC Bill).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you go to apply for electricity to be connected to your premises at any KPLC office near you, they will automatically issue you a meter once you complete all the necessary procedures. Most people will tend to pay their KPLC bill without bothering to understand how the utility arrived at the figures. However, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try and understand how your facility consumes electricity, so that you can be better placed to understand how much you stand to pay for electricity. If you are interested in gaining more insights on how different sections of your facility consume power, then you are better off investing in a real time energy monitor.
