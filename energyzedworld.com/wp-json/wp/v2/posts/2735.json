There exists several sources of renewable energy. However, whenever renewable energy is mentioned, we quickly think of solar energy, perhaps due to is popularity among many people.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other renewable energy\u00a0sources such as biomass energy which\u00a0is generated from plants\u00a0e.g.\u00a0corn &amp; animal waste such as\u00a0cow dung.\u00a0It is renewable in that we can grow crops and trees over &amp; over again.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Biomass energy can be obtained in 3 ways:<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Burning- burning biomass generates heat which can be used to heat homes or create steam which can then generate electricity\u00a0\u00a0<\/li><li>Biofuels- crops such as sugarcane can be converted into a biofuel known\u00a0as ethanol. This\u00a0can be to\u00a0used\u00a0fuel cars. In\u00a0addition, vegetable\u00a0oils and animal fats can generate\u00a0biodiesel which\u00a0can be used as heating oil and also to power vehicles.\u00a0<\/li><li>Methane gas- rotting\u00a0biomass generates methane gas which can be used to\u00a0make natural\u00a0gas which is a common source of energy.\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biomass and the Environment<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the fact that\u00a0it is\u00a0renewable,\u00a0generation of\u00a0biomass energy has several negative impacts on the environment. Some of these include:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>If not checked, can lead to deforestation\u00a0when trees are cut to generate wood fuel\u00a0<\/li><li>Air pollution from burning\u00a0releases\u00a0greenhouse\u00a0gas such as CO2 into the atmosphere\u00a0<\/li><li>The land cleared for growing corn and sugar cane can reduce habitats and destroy\u00a0ecosystems\u00a0<\/li><li>Opportunity cost whereby the land used for growing biomass could be used to grow other crops for food\u00a0<\/li><li>Planting of crops and trees require\u00a0use\u00a0of\u00a0fertilizers and other chemicals that can cause\u00a0water pollution\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, although biomass energy is renewable, it could also have adverse effects on the environment and there is need to come with a ways to strike a balance between the two.\u00a0<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-2603732684\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Monica Ngage The current increase in pollution has greatly contributed to climate change, therefore, there\u2019s need to shift to clean and renewable sources of energy.
