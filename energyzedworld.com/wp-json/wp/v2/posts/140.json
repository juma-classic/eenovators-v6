You first must ensure you have the requisite combination of both academic and professional experience. <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The table below details what academic qualifications and experience are required for the license. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Education (Academic)\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Professional (Job)<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A <strong>degree in technology or engineering<\/strong> or equivalent in a relevant field.<\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;\">At least <\/span><strong style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;\">three years<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;\"> work experience in <\/span><strong style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;\">Energy\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;\">operations or Maintenance or Planning<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Post graduate Engineer<\/strong> (Masters of Engineering \/ Masters of Technology)<\/td>\n<td>At least <strong>two years<\/strong> work experience in\u00a0<strong>Energy <\/strong>operations or Maintenance or Planning<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A <strong>graduate Engineer<\/strong> with <strong>postgraduate degree in Energy\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Management<\/strong> or equivalent<\/td>\n<td>At least <strong>two years<\/strong> work experience in\u00a0<strong>Energy <\/strong>operations or Maintenance or Planning<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher <strong>National Diploma<\/strong> Engineer or equivalent<\/td>\n<td>At least <strong>six years<\/strong> work experience in\u00a0<strong>Energy <\/strong>operations or Maintenance or Planning<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A <strong>post graduate degree in Physics<\/strong> or Electronics or Chemistry (with Physics and Mathematics at graduation level)<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At least <strong>three years<\/strong> work experience in <strong>Energy <\/strong>operations or Maintenance or Planning<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A First <strong>degree in Architecture<\/strong> or equivalent field<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At least <strong>three years<\/strong> work experience in design and use of <strong>Energy efficient\u00a0<\/strong><strong>buildings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A <strong>Masters degree in Architecture<\/strong> or equivalent in relevant field.<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At least <strong>two years<\/strong> work experience in design and use of <strong>Energy efficient buildings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">II. Energy management certification<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have attained both academic and professional qualification. You must also attain an energy management certification from a body recognized by the<a href=\"http:\/\/erc.go.ke\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Energy Regulatory Commission <\/a>(ERC), or Post Graduate Diploma in Energy Management, or Masters of Science in Energy Management from a recognized University.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eenovators offers a training called Certified Energy Manager (CEM) and Certified Energy Auditor(CEA) from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aeecenter.org\/i4a\/pages\/index.cfm?pageid=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Association of Energy Engineers <\/a>(AEE). This training is recognized by ERC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">III. Work with a licensed auditor and acquire 5 energy audits <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have both step I and II, you need to work with a licensed auditor and acquire 5 energy audits. This is normally a tough step since not so many people are doing quality energy audits. You also must decide which category of energy auditor license you want to attain. There are two categories of licensed energy auditors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1)\u00a0Category A \u2013 <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to have at least 5 energy audits one of which must be an investment grade audit<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2)\u00a0Category B- <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to have conducted at least 5 general audits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you have all the 3 steps checked, you go to the ERC online portal and make your application. The portal can be accessed @ <a href=\"https:\/\/portal.erc.go.ke\">https:\/\/portal.erc.go.ke<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If ERC finds your papers and qualifications valid. They will invite you to a written interview. If you score more than 50% in the written interview, they will invite you to an oral interview. You will then be awarded the license if you are successful in both interviews. So if you have an <a href=\"http:\/\/eenovators.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">energy auditing firm<\/a>, you can use your auditor license to license it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\u2019s pretty much it.
