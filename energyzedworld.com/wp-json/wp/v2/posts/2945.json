Yet that is what sells these days right? I know <em>coz <\/em>I watch them [a lot].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;The truth is that energy efficiency is too dry and scientific a topic to keep the attention of an average person who has multiple options on how to spend their time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as a consumer, I want to let you in on a little secret that actually converts me into a buyer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh wait, you must be wondering how I suddenly became a marketing guru yet I am just a clueless user who watches prank videos on YouTube, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0I would love to get into that with you but just go to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/intl\/en-gb\/consumer-insights\/consumer-journey\/navigating-purchase-behavior-and-decision-making\/\" target=\"_blank\">Decoding Decisions: The purchase <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/intl\/en-gb\/consumer-insights\/consumer-journey\/navigating-purchase-behavior-and-decision-making\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">behavior<\/a><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/intl\/en-gb\/consumer-insights\/consumer-journey\/navigating-purchase-behavior-and-decision-making\/\" target=\"_blank\"> &#8211; Think with Google<\/a>. It will help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, here is what turns me into a potential buyer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Make Energy Efficiency A Rule Of The Thumb<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A fact is that energy efficiency isn\u2019t a rule of the thumb for many users. So tell them over and over until it becomes available for them as a Yardstick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Energy efficient products promoters need to show up and repeat the advantages of energy efficiency to potential buyers across all platforms until it becomes a basis for decision making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It needs to become a trigger during a consumer\u2019s exploration stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scouring through an electronic allay in one of the supermarkets, I happened upon a set of refrigerators. I was spoilt for choice. A lady sales rep for a certain exquisite brand approached me and started reeling me in;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Excuse me boss, check this out; this is a silver, double door, 365 liters\u2026.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stopped listening because she didn\u2019t start with the energy consumption part. But that\u2019s because I knew what I wanted. Not many people do. Either way I checked out the equipment and voila! As rare as they are in Kenya, it was rated <strong>5 star<\/strong> in terms of energy consumption. The most efficient of all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lady should have lead with;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cThis is the most energy efficient refrigerator in Kenya and it comes with a double door, 365 liters\u2026.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She clearly didn\u2019t understand the strength of what she was selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was important to me because of the fact that <strong>a refrigerator uses up to 14%<\/strong> of a household\u2019s total energy consumption. Again, most people do not know this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not assume that they know! Tell them. Lead them using such facts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tie It To My Money<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One fact about energy inefficient equipment in the Kenyan market is that they are cheap and readily available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given this fact, catching a consumer\u2019s interest becomes a herculean task for energy efficient equipment sellers because the consumer is being influenced by the power of \u201cnow\u201d. Inefficient equipment seem more available and within reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy efficient equipment on the other hand tend to have a higher initial cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, a marketer might again need to highlight that the <strong>operational cost of an inefficient equipment <\/strong>at the end of a 2 year period will be enough to buy a second cheap equipment! Especially for one in a shop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have these facts and talk about them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if I were to walk away, believe that you have my interest now. Money matters to all of us so I will definitely listen to what you have to say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Simplify My Evaluation<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where most of highly technical promoters go wrong yet it is the most important stage at which I might decide to buy the energy efficient equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You already have my interest and I now know that you have authority in such matters so don\u2019t be too technical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever I look up \u201cenergy efficiency\u201d articles that are supposed to sell me on such equipment, I am usually bombarded by a barrage of technical details. At the end of the day I rarely know what I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point all that is needed is for you to simplify. There is a lot of science behind energy efficiency but leave that out. Instead, tell me the advantages at the point of consumption and in the simplest form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may only need <strong>social proof<\/strong> as a weapon at this point. Just say everyone else is making a smart choice in buying it. I shouldn\u2019t then miss out on such opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By now chances are that I might have already made a decision to buy from you. I just need simple reasons to justify my imminent expenditure. Reasons that I relate to for that matter. Give them to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope reading this was worth your time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Author\u2019s contact: <strong><em>+254 715 659 632 or +254 701 554 017<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linkedin:\u00a0 <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/\" target=\"_blank\">Feed | LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-3843431161\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Consumer\u2019s Perspective On What Actually Convinces Him To Buy Energy Efficient Appliances For His Home.
