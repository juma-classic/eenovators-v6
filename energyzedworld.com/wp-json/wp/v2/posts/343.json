In some cases, electricity is not viewed as a commodity but a right. And one thing about a right is that it\u2019s supposed to be free. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that is not true, power is paid for and that is why it unsettles people whenever the bills are so high. It is just hard to relate electricity with money in the consumers\u2019 eyes because they don\u2019t even know how it is billed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is one aspect upon which consumers agree, and that is billing is directly related to amount of electricity one consumes.

Of importance to note is that the cost of electricity is going up in terms of financial, environmental and health impacts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article seeks to inform you on how you can green your electricity and its use thus reducing your bills. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> <strong>Green electricity tips<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong><em>Audit your electricity use<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Conducting an audit at home simply means finding out how you use power and what consumes it more. You can hire an expert or do it yourself. You basically find out your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.resnet.us\/home-energy-audits\">home\u2019s energy use<\/a>, where it\u2019s lost and where savings can be done. It could be in lighting, ironing of clothes, water heating, cooking, electronics, air conditioning, or refrigeration. A couple of these have to be the biggest consumers and something can be done to reduce such consumption. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <em><strong>Intentionally purpose to cut or reduce your electricity use<\/strong><\/em><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally after a home audit has been done, action has to be taken to reduce the electricity consumed. These include simple energy saving tips that are completely cost effective.

Ask if you have to, take a phone and call an energy expert for advice. Otherwise, you might end up buying the flashiest model of a refrigerator with high power demand. Look for<a href=\"http:\/\/https:\/\/www.energystar.gov\/\"> Energy Star rated<\/a> products. Electronics like computers and audio systems can also suck a lot of power. Use laptops rather than desktops if your uses permit. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. <em><strong>Consider renewable energy like solar<\/strong><\/em><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There is enough energy from the sun to run all human activities.

This power can also be used to charge your phones and other electronics. There are electronics that have chargeable backups like cameras, laptops, cell phones and MP3 players that can be charged using solar energy. In heating water, set up a solar water heating system and you will never pay a dime for heating water for the rest of your life.

If you want to build a home, consider involving an energy efficiency expert who will help design your house. He will look into home orientation to the sun, flow of wind with an aim of reducing energy that will be used by occupants in heating and cooling. Also, there will be less light bulb fittings because in many cases, we don\u2019t need a number of bulbs in a room where few would serve the intended purpose just fine. <\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-911524544\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Ombajo V Gedion Electricity consumers are often complaining about high power bills, everyone does not seem to be at ease paying high power bills.
