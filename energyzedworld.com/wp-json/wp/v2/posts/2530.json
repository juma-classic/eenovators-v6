There are however some sectors that are thriving. Restricted movement, stay at home and inter county lock in orders have forced factories, offices and other buildings to close. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shutdown of schools and other public facilities have also rendered them ghost towns. These closures have led to a decline in energy requirements and energy consumption. Italy has reported a 27% drop in energy consumption since they started their lockdown while the USA energy consumption has fallen to a 16-year low. The global energy demand is likely to plummet by at least 6%. This is almost the amount of energy used in the whole of India alone!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 13<sup>th<\/sup> March 2020, Kenya reported its first patient who tested positive for Corona Virus. Thereafter, there have been a raft of measures aimed to contain the virus and stop its exponential spread. Some of the measures included closing of schools and public facilities, enforcing of a 7pm to 5am curfew and a cessation of movement in and out of some counties. While a total lockdown has not been ruled out, the government has encouraged as many people as possible to work from home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we are going to evaluate how 5 different industries have reacted to the Covid-19 measures based on their energy consumption. We have put real time energy consumption meters in these 5 different industries and thus we are able to see how their energy profile has changed especially after the 13<sup>th<\/sup> of March 2020. The five industries include a school, two hotels, telecom site, a shopping mall and a flower farm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>A School Based In Nairobi<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately the first covid-19 case was announced in Kenya, schools and other educational facilities were given a 3 day notice to close and send students home. Below is the energy consumption profile of a school we are monitoring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"601\" height=\"377\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2532 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image.png 601w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-189x120.png 189w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 601px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 601\/377;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a sharp drop of energy consumption in this school because the students were sent home. They had a daily base load after shutdown. This is because some staff live in the school and other areas like the kitchen and laundry still consume some energy. From the analysis, there could be opportunity to see what they can do reduce further on the base load and reduce their energy cost since they are not in operation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a pie chart showing their energy balance after the whole school has been closed down:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"601\" height=\"319\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2533 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-1.png 601w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-1-300x159.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 601px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 601\/319;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kitchen and senior school are still consuming energy and that can be an area to look further and conserve energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The table below shows that the school reduced its energy consumption by around 48%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Before Covid Average<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>After Covid Average<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>% Change<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2061<\/td><td>1078<\/td><td>-48%<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Hotel Industry<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We have our real time monitors in various hotels and have picked two hotels for purposes of this comparative analysis.

Shopping malls and flowers farms also recorded a drop of energy and this could be because of reduced operation hours because of the curfew. It is important therefore for schools and hotels to ensure that they do not consume as much during this pandemic period when they have very low occupancy in their facilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malls can also lookout on the changes in baseload and ensure no idle equipment are running during curfew times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The telecom space recorded the least drop in energy consumption, in as much as there is increased traffic and activities like internet data, mobile money and increased phone calls. It is possible that traffic has no correlation to energy consumption in the telecom space. This is something worth investigating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From this analysis we can tell that maybe the whole country will also experience a reduction in demand since the commercial and industrial space are the largest consumers of electrical energy in Kenya. This drop of demand is not a good thing because the country is trying to increase its electricity demand due to surplus generation. Reduction in energy consumption is only very good if we either increase productivity or keep producing at the same level.<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-384187751\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Chris Mbori Covid-19 pandemic has sent shock waves in almost every sector and most sectors of the economy have been hard hit.
