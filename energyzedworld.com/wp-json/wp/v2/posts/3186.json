The program is running with 10 cohorts who applied, were interviewed and then accepted into the program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program entails an energy audit technician course and essential skills training on the first phase and mentorship and a six months internship on the second phase of the internship. The first phase of the program was completed and the students excelled in their exams. Eenovators organized a colorful mini graduation to celebrate this great milestone with the YEEP cohorts. They shared their great experiences during the graduation ceremony.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Experiences on the YEEP program<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"161\" height=\"188\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/gloria.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3188 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 161px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 161\/188;\" \/><figcaption><strong>Gloria Maruti<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;YEEP has been an amazing experience for me.

Tutors have been willing to make us understand. Essential skills have been of impact now I know how to write great application letters and\u00a0CV.

Meeting a new environment where the tutors are more concerned on how better I have understood has been so amazing. Secondly, it has taught me to be more open-minded, I have interacted with engineers from different fields\u2019 chemical, mechanical, electrical engineering. This has helped me open up to new ideas and be an all-around person. The essential skills classes have been a great experience for I knew as an engineer you should only be concerned with designing or installing systems but essential skills training have taught me how to communicate while designing and installing systems. It has also taught me skills on how to work in a team. It has been such a great experience and I&#8217;m thankful for the opportunity .I look forward and eager for a better experience in the next six months.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Cindy.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3191 lazyload\" width=\"167\" height=\"184\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Cindy.jpg 350w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Cindy-272x300.jpg 272w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 167px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 167\/184;\" \/><figcaption><strong>Cindy Mureithi<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSince high school, I have always wanted to do something with electrical engineering although I didn\u2019t study it in campus. \u00a0YEEP gave me this opportunity to learn on electrical engineering. The experience has been fun, remembering the expectations that we were asked during the orientation to the program I would say I am way informed than before, being one of the people who have already visited the sites it was fun and enjoyable doing the installations. Applying what I was taught in class in the site and looking for measures to improve on energy savings and efficiency in the host sites is exciting. On the essential skills training the session on Emotional intelligence has largely impacted my life especially on how I react to situations. Reflecting back, now I don\u2019t react to situations like I used to before. I hope that even as we get to our internship sites and encounter challenges we will be able to overcome these challenges by applying what we were taught in class.

I remember being unsure of what exactly I wanted to do after campus. I was however lucky to get to join the program I would say YEEP has given me ways in which I can impact the world through energy. Right now I see opportunities I can use to implement clean energy and also encourage energy savings in the commercial and residential buildings. The program has helped me build great friendships bringing new experiences. I appreciate the trainers who showed us what we expect in the real work environment which was very informative. Essential skills training encouraged us to look at things differently and I&#8217;m very thankful for that. I&#8217;m very eager for the internship where we are going to make the real impact.

To actualize this moment that we are enjoying right now, I congratulate my fellow cohorts for their success this far. I hope the same temple or more will be maintained or exceed during the second phase. I convey my candid appreciation to the coordinating crew and the training team both in the essential and technical training everything they have done has been spectacular and their high levels of dedication have come through for us. When we were joining we had the mindset that has an engineer you deal with tools, but into the program, we learned that we cannot execute this without the confidence or without the right set of mindset and skills, essential skills have been the best part of this program being very impactful in the way we interact with each other. From these sessions, I have learned excellent communication is very crucial everything done with good communication it will flow seamlessly. I thank Eenovators for this opportunity.

It was just randomly that I came to learn about this program while I was doing a research on climate change and I met a friend who informed me about this program. When I applied for it I knew I was to be trained online. \u00a0When the program started it was not purely online but I took the risk although I was doing my research at the time. Looking back to all the things I have learned and the friendships I have made I am very happy. It is a new experience for phase 2 since I will be moving to a new town which is another risk I am very happy to take. I look forward to where this endeavor will take me.
