This article will introduce a tool developed by energy professionals for the measurement and verification process as well as reporting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"case-study-1\">Case Study 1<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider a facility in Kenya with office space. The organization needed help with the office space\u2019s cost of energy and contracted an energy service company to assess energy consumption within the section and recommend appropriate actions. The organization contracted a consultant to help identify and recommend solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The consultant found that the facility still relied heavily on fluorescents for indoor artificial lighting though some sections had installed LED lighting. The audit team also noted that the facility operated on a 9-hour workday for 5 days a week with the sixth day having a 6-hour workday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The audit team focused on the facility\u2019s fluorescent sources as they showed the highest potential in energy-saving potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The facility implemented the recommendation selecting 99 fixtures for the efficiency test. The task at hand at this point became identifying the portion of the change in consumption over the following weeks that was a direct result of switching from fluorescents to LEDs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"model-identification\">Model identification<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The facility had a real-time monitor logging energy consumption in various sections within the office space. Discussions and interviews with facility staff identified occupancy as one of the main factors affecting the organization\u2019s lighting load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the staff could did not collect occupancy data previously. However, the team noted that higher occupancy would always mean increased energy consumption within the kitchen section whose data was being collected by the energy management platform. Tests on this sections viability involved multiple linear correlation between total lighting load and kitchen loads which included kitchen sockets and the cooker with January 2021 as a sample range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 1 shows the results of this study.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/11.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3289 lazyload\" width=\"548\" height=\"413\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/11.png 548w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/11-480x362.png 480w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 548px, 100vw\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 548px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 548\/413;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Linear model equation:<br><em>2. -Total Lighting Load* (kWh)= (2.390 \u00d7 1. -Kitchen Sockets (kWh)) + (3.341 \u00d7 1. -Cooker unit (kWh)) + 2.665<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coefficient of determination (Adjusted R<sup>2<\/sup>): 0.9214<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The Adjusted R<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;value (0.9214) (the square of the correlation coefficient), indicates that 92.1380% of the variation in 2. -Total Lighting Load* (kWh) may be explained by the independent variables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The Adjusted R<sup>2<\/sup>&nbsp;value (0.9214) indicates a good correlation between 2. -Total Lighting Load* (kWh) and the independent variables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This realization allowed the next step involving the use of the Eagles Energy management Platform to generate a Measurement and Verification report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Project Set-up<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This section involves filling up a form on the platform to allow the platform\u2019s identification of data required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/22-1024x606.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3290 lazyload\" width=\"506\" height=\"298\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 506px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 506\/298;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 2: General M&amp;V data<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This section identifies the basic M&amp;V parameters such as baseline data range and M&amp;V option selection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 3 shows model selected as well as M&amp;V data<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/33.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3292 lazyload\" width=\"518\" height=\"300\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/33.png 518w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/33-480x278.png 480w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 518px, 100vw\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 518px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 518\/300;\" \/><figcaption>Figure 3: Model Type and Data Selection<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/portal.eenovators.com\/engineer\/engineer_zone\/processing\"><\/a>This section helps identify modelling approach as well as data to be modelled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is an editable report whose main sections identify actual savings accrued by the facility during the reporting period as shown by Figure 4<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/44.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3296 lazyload\" width=\"488\" height=\"422\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/44.png 488w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/44-480x415.png 480w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 488px, 100vw\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 488px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 488\/422;\" \/><figcaption>Figure 4: Savings Analysis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform also allows for the inclusion of non-routine adjustments to adjust the reporting period based on changes to the same.
