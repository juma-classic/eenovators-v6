Admittedly, I got into it for all the wrong reasons, chief among them being that I wouldn\u2019t have a lot of classmates to contend with, which spoke immensely of my introverted nature. Looking back now, I was excited to do something new, something that was outside of the conventional courses that everyone aspired to do and one that no one would be able to dictate what career path I should take after I was done. It was a mind-opening experience to delve into the world of energy. It felt like love at first sight as I continued to learn and my passion for the energy space grew with each unit I took.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may not be very passionate about climate change as most of my peers in this space, but I do feel much needs to be done in terms of educating people about energy. It was unfortunate that I got into the heart of energy during my final two years on campus (it was a four-year course) and I left feeling very unsatisfied with what I had gleaned from my lecturers. For the most part, I couldn\u2019t really explain what I was learning in school. When someone asked what my course entailed, I would just answer, \u2018You know, Renewable Energy\u2019 and leave it at that. The other person would be left with the choice to either stereotype it to Solar or do follow-up questions to really understand what I meant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/youth-in-energy-empowerment-program-yeep\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/youth-in-energy-empowerment-program-yeep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YEEP<\/a> was really a godsend for the fresh out-of-campus me. I finally had a chance to interact one-on-one with people who were actually working in the energy field. The program had been introduced to me by one of my classmates during an event we had been called for. Some weeks after, a flyer was shared in our class group and I decided to shoot my shot. I didn\u2019t even have a clue about who <a href=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eenovators<\/a> were before then. Again, I had thought that not many people would apply for the training but I was shocked to find out more than 200 people were vying for an opportunity to be taken on board the <a href=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/youth-in-energy-empowerment-program-yeep\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/youth-in-energy-empowerment-program-yeep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YEEP program<\/a>. I think that was the first time I was ever anxious about whether I would get in or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward, I got enrolled in the program. Though I had covered most of the topics in my coursework, it was more insightful for me to have a global view of the energy space from people who were living in it. I finally understood that it wasn\u2019t just about dealing with renewable energy technologies and production, but there was a huge need for Energy Management. My focus was widened to how much potential the space had to offer in terms of Energy Management Systems, developing the education capacity, and the technology that could be developed within the space. I felt as though I had found my heart again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My aspirations within energy seem to grow with each experience that I am gaining during my internship period. Key things that I have been able to gain include procedures followed in energy audits including safety. Conducting presentations on the audit findings, data analysis, technology already in use, report writing, and communication with the clients and the team. I have also come into contact with the leadership that entails being able to influence people to be more aware of their role in consuming energy and that they are in a position to manage their energy usage. Being a person who largely conformed to the \u2018engineering\u2019 way of doing things, it has been very interesting to grow my soft skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As my involvement with YEEP and <a href=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eenovators<\/a> continues, I find myself motivated to create a space for myself in the energy field. Whatever milestones I\u2019ll make in the future, I\u2019ll always remember that it all started from the colors that <a href=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/youth-in-energy-empowerment-program-yeep\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/youth-in-energy-empowerment-program-yeep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YEEP<\/a> painted before me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-3691314435\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Catherine Njeri My debut into the energy space didn\u2019t start with YEEP (Youth in Energy Empowerment Program), but with my Undergrad in Energy Technology.
