Soaring: <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>An Eagle usually flies high above the storm, and its only encounter is with fellow Eagles. No other bird dares fly this high as they are afraid of the storms. It is not afraid to use its majestic wings to fly against these strong winds.&nbsp; Instead of viewing the strong winds as a barrier, they leverage on the pressure of the storm to glide higher without having to use their energy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/Zg_tbdqW_1chU5Bpq3qPeUI7CjbCgv2xt0r2GP8bCpxwL_TO6i1yMRSLLTYFdgEKan9GgHv9B5QMVLI8fq2NjNKFuFNneP8Hy5NYdLxcWO5_ecRw4aydok-9_FN0OzTLx-u5K6eCPS3NPFTM4Q\" alt=\"bald-eagle-wallpapers-flight\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Precision: <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the Eagle focuses on prey, it is accurate in its execution. Eagles are well known for their accuracy in capturing prey. Once it sets its eyes on prey, it never misses it. The muscle in the eyes continuously adjusts the curvature of the eyeballs to maintain sharp focus and accurate perception throughout the approach and attack.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/xdYt2dXcNLe1OYIip91sAtTvddNwYSwxMTK8bHLTC-FthtM0tMppMW83p-HrNetfYWtJp0PiXNhgEZrdsBGOlcfzwOBsIt3vCVsGgE9zYVsw4KQBVpCCvWxJH8LKTYJ_FLoQGgmoadpbiDe_SA\" alt=\"haliaeetus_leucocephalus2\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Adventure: <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Eagles love to take new challenges and are not afraid of the storm. They don&#8217;t settle for dead things like vultures. They go for a fresh meat hunt even if that means preying on a goat which is more significant than them in size. An Eagle is not afraid to step out of its comfort zone and try out new things. The adventurous nature of an Eagle makes it survive longer than an average bird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Having said enough about Eagles, what lessons can energy managers learn from Eagles?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot to learn from the Eagles, and their magnificence is inexhaustible. As an energy manager or facility manager concerned with the daily activities of your company where energy is at the core of everything, you need to be self-aware of what goes where and what comes out. An energy audit will not save you money on its own. Action is necessary to realize the full benefits of an energy audit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to wear special glasses to enable you to scrutinize where your energy spending goes and where there are potential energy wastages. An energy monitoring solution comes into play as part of your arsenal to reduce consumption. Just like an Eagle can see far, real-time energy consumption enables you to measure and determine your energy usage now and make forecasts on future energy spending.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Machine operators can also get deep insights into the efficiency of the equipment. They can then be able to take proactive measures to prolong your equipment lifespan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quick action is required to save money and energy. Whenever energy wastage occurs, such as a motor running with no load, it needs to be switched off. However, how does one determine that a piece of equipment running in your facility is idle, for example?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New technologies in energy monitoring will help you make a profile of your regular operations. Any deviations from norm will automatically trigger an alert and pinpoint the exact location.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This call to action triggers requires an energy manager who is quick to take action and attends to problems as they happen.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you have an energy monitoring solution at your facility?&nbsp;<\/strong><br><\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-3264469550\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Paul Muhia, Eagles.&nbsp; For centuries, these seemingly larger-than-life birds have fascinated and inspired us with their brilliant characteristics and abilities.
