He narrated the story of how Eenovators began as an idea on an exercise book and through the support of mentors and the team at Eenovators, was able to grow it to where it is today. He reminisced of his days in university and the opportunities that had passed his fellow students by as a result of not participating. He asked the students not to do the same and to take advantage of the opportunity the WED Student Innovation Challenge offered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The head of the registration and membership committee at AEPEA, Michael Kili, was also present to speak to the students about the efforts that the association is putting into inclusion of students into the energy arena. He spoke of the strides the association has made in creating energy awareness across the country. He urged the students not to be left out in the student challenge and to put their best foot forward as the association was ready to assist them to catapult their ideas to new levels. Pauline Mweu, the student representative at AEPEA, made a presentation on what AEPEA had to offer to the student fraternity. She gave a simple breakdown on how to join the association and what benefits the students stood to reap from the experience, including internships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone wp-image-1097 size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1040\" height=\"780\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/103.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1097 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/103.jpeg 1040w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/103-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/103-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/103-1024x768.jpeg 1024w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1040px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1040\/780;\" \/><figcaption>Guest speakers; Andy, Chris, Michael and Pauline.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Andy Amadi, hailed as the god father of energy in Kenya, gave a key note address where gave the students encouragement to be part of the challenge. He drew examples from his university days, narrating of projects that he undertook that catapulted his career in energy.

One example he gave was of the Bidco founder, Vimal Shah, who had the idea to begin the manufacturing giant as he did his project proposal at the university. Andy challenged the students to think of solutions that would resolve Africa\u2019s problems. He said that he was convinced that for instance, grass had the ability to be the next frontier of energy production in Africa due to its availability and its potential to be explored as an energy source.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone wp-image-1098 size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1040\" height=\"780\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/101.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1098 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/101.jpeg 1040w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/101-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/101-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/101-1024x768.jpeg 1024w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1040px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1040\/780;\" \/><figcaption>Andy Amadi.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MC of the day and Strategy Director at Eenovators, Carolyne Gathuru, was full of energy and engaged the audience with exciting energizers and enticing gifts that had everyone on edge.
