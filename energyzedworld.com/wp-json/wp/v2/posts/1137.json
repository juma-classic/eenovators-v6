Although I may not be amongst the best writers known, here I am and this is my story.. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of my colleagues will agree to this; it is usually an engineers\u2019 inside joke &#8211; that \u2018we\u2019 are not good in English &#8211; but heck, we are<br>kings and queens in math right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, back to serious business \u2026\u2026\u2026. first of all, I will dearly miss the Eenovators family. I have learnt a lot from them not only career-wise but also on life skills. Secondly, you can call me \u2018the youngest energy<br>auditing guru\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I promise I have learnt a lot on Energy Auditing. I mean, what do you expect after learning from the best professionals on this field?<br>There are a couple of things that I have learnt in this period that I really found very interesting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Free cooling system<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Free cooling saves energy and operating expenses at Telecommunications sites and chilling water in industrial sites, where the application of traditional air conditioners has resulted in very high energy costs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using free cooling, the overall thermal management running expenditure can be reduced by up to 90%. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The working principle of free cooling is simple; when outdoor temperatures are lower relative to indoor temperatures, this system utilizes the cool outdoor air as a free cooling source and when the outdoor temperature is higher to indoor temperatures, the air conditioner automatically<br>comes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Air curtains<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This was one of the recommendations that the flower farms needed to install at the cold room doors due to the heat exchange. The following is an explanation in detail on how<br>the air curtain works. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally the air entering through the inlet grille, sometimes with filter functions, is compressed by internal fans and forced thought an air outlet, which is directed at the open doorway. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filter protects the interior components (heat exchanger, fans, electronics, etc.) from dust and particles. The fans of the air curtain can be direct or belt driven. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most frequently used types are centrifugal, axial and cross-flow. Some air outlets and\/or lamellas can be adjustable to increase the performance of<br>the air curtain according to each situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these principle are very interesting especially if you get to get to see them practically. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I would like to thank team Eenovators for the great support they have given us though this learning period.
