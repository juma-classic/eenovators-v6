This became a new source of wealth but also led to conflicts arising among the pastoral Turkana people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okudo&#8217;s  role was to speak on behalf of women in the energy and extractive sector by informing industry participants and decision-makers of the challenges and opportunities women are finding in pursuing careers in these sectors. All this time, oil had not yet been discovered in Kenya.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Okudo\u2019s company, which has 15 employees in five countries, is a social enterprise focused on bridging the gender gap in oil, gas, mining and alternative energy sectors in Africa. The organization also has over 75 volunteers in 10 countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first time Okudo is in the lime light for her great achievements, she has been recognized internationally and is a recipient of many awards including President Uhuru Kenyatta recognizing her in 2018 as one of the young female Kenyan trailblazers, being awarded the Under 30 Women in Energy East Africa (2018) and in 2019, the Kenya Upstream Oil and Gas Woman of the Year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, accompanying President Uhuru Kenyatta as part of the Kenyan delegation to the United Nations, she had the privilege of addressing the Economic and Social Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations Ogutu Okudo!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-1988067942\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Ruth Carol Atieno Yes you heard that right, Kenya&#8217;s Ogutu Okudo, 28, named in Forbe&#8217;s Africa&#8217;s list 2020.
