It\u2019s also a reminder to embrace the opportunities climate action bring along like green jobs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What can we do?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On this day, we can join the rest of the world a series of online discussions, events and actions which can be done from the comfort of our homes or from wherever we are, considering the current coronavirus situation and the rule on distancing and social gatherings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explore the many virtual Earth Day events by simply searching on google to find an event that works for you and join discussions on twitter and other social media platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, let us all keep our environment at heart by taking climate action.&nbsp; Plant trees, discourage deforestation, adopt energy management and water management solutions, and opt for renewable energy and clean energy solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eenovators wishes you a happy Earth Day.
