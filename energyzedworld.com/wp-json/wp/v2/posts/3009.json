The EPC outlines the commitment by the ESCO to install the necessary equipment, provides a performance guarantee and establishes the terms of any ongoing payments or repayments by the client, which are intended to be less than the financial savings realised by the project. &nbsp;Such contracts last for a period of 2-20 years depending on the measures to be implemented. The two most common types of EPCs are the (a) shared savings or (b) guaranteed savings model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shared Savings model<\/strong>: the ESCO can provide financing, as well as project development and implementation costs, with the energy savings shared between the ESCO and the client over the contract period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/22-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3003 lazyload\" width=\"793\" height=\"445\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 793px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 793\/445;\" \/><figcaption>Diagram 1<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Guaranteed Savings model<\/strong>: the ESCO guarantees a certain savings on the client\u2019s energy bill.
