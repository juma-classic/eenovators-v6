These kind of clothing is often worn to alert\ndrivers, vehicle and machinery operators of a worker&#8217;s presence. And most\nespecially in low light and dark conditions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One may consider having a high-visibility\nheadwear to increase their visibility in situations where part or all of their\nbody could be obscured e.g. when working in leafy areas with many trees,\ntraffic barriers, construction materials, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Situation that require High-Visibility Safety\nApparel<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>High-visibility clothing allow you to\nbe seen by the drivers and or machinery operators sooner and more readily. This\nfact increases your safety at work. You must have HVSA if;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>You are working\nwhen there is low light and poor visibility.<\/li><li>You are working\naround moving vehicles (cars, trucks or other machinery traveling under their\nown power &#8211; e.g., forklifts, backhoes, etc). <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to choose the High &#8211; Visibility Safety\nApparel that will work best for you.<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is recommended that an initial\nhazard assessment be carried out on each job site to evaluate the site for\nknown or potential hazards a worker may encounter while performing the job.\nThis assessment will help to determine the risk to workers of being hit by\nmoving vehicles and the environmental conditions under which work is performed.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When doing the hazard assessment where\nHVSA might be required, consider the following;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Type and nature\nof the work being carried out &#8211; including the tasks of both the HVSA wearer and\nany drivers.<\/li><li>If workers will\nbe exposed to heat and\/or flames. If so, flame-resistant HVSA would be\nrequired.<\/li><li>Work conditions,\nsuch as indoor or outdoor work, temperature, work rates, traffic flow, traffic\nvolume, visibility, etc.<\/li><li>The workplace\nenvironment and the background workers must be seen in (e.g., is the visual\narea behind the workers simple, complex, urban, rural, highway, filled with\nequipment, cluttered).<\/li><li>How long the\nworker is exposed to various traffic hazards, including traffic speeds.<\/li><li>Lighting\nconditions and how the natural light might be affected by changing weather.<\/li><li>Factors that\naffect warning distances and times, such as the volume of traffic, the size of\nvehicles, their potential speeds and their ability to stop quickly, and surface\nconditions.<\/li><li>If there are any\nengineering and administrative hazard controls already in place (e.g., barriers\nthat separate the workers from traffic).<\/li><li>Any distractions\nthat could draw workers attention away from hazards.<\/li><li>The sightlines of\nvehicle operators, especially when vehicles are operated in reverse.<\/li><li>For certain jobs,\nthere\u2019s need to be &#8220;visually&#8221; identifiable from other workers in the\narea.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a hazard assessment is complete,\nappropriate controls can be selected. The first line of defense for workers&#8217;\nsafety would be to control the design of the workplace and reduce the exposure\nof workers to moving vehicles (e.g., through the use of physical barriers and\nother engineering and administrative controls). Using high-visibility apparel\nwould be the last line of defense against accidents by providing more warning\nto vehicle operators that workers are on foot in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to look for when purchasing High-Visibility\nSafety Apparel.<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Size, Coverage and Design<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Large, bright\ngarments are more visible than small ones.
