The objective of this paper is achieved through interviewing Turkana<br \/>County private and public sector stakeholders, conducting surveys and analyzing secondary data.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hydrocarbons have emerged as a resource that holds most promise with an anticipated USD 3 billion investment on the horizon. The demand of exploration, development, production, and transportation oil &amp; gas products and services continue to significantly increase. Hydrocarbon riparian industries continue to benefit significantly and this phenomenon is bound to increase.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Turkana County and its environs have also in the recent past become a forerunner in green energy development. Geothermal, Wind, Solar and now a candidate for nuclear power plant by 2027 has significantly opened up green and climate change capital inflows. These revenues have significantly boosted energy accessibility and continue to inject much need revenues into the county.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the above Turkana remains to be among the least grid connect midst the 47 Kenyan counties. Much remains to be done in the areas of manpower development and the empowerment of local enterprises to match the current and upcoming energy-related opportunities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Policies and legislation frameworks needs to fine-tune to continue promoting local content development, equitable energy revenue sharing, and attraction of investment especially in mini-grids and off-grid systems, manpower development, inclusion and participation of constitutionally recognized marginalized groups among other developmental frontiers.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-2913514298\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[wpdm_package id=&#8217;2050&#8242;] Since Kenya\u2019s independence, the Turkana region has been marginalized.
