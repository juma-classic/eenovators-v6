I am a student of a program to develop and train young energy auditors that is an initiative by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ledet.gov.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"LEDET (opens in a new tab)\">LEDET<\/a> a South African municipality based in Limpopo province with the help of Yolanda De Lange from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aeecenter.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Entf (opens in a new tab)\">Entf<\/a> (Energy Training Foundation). She and her team enrol groups of young men and women to participate in this program that is inclusive of theory and practicals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I will not speak of the theory much as it was long and all very technical, but I will say it was filled with a group of very educated and qualified people. I was one of the lucky people to be part of an international trainership to Kenya the land of the Maasai people, and this is where my journey started.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I arrived on the 28 of September 2019 at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi and was welcomed by Ruth one of the communications people at <a href=\"http:\/\/eenovators.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Eenovators (opens in a new tab)\">Eenovators<\/a> the home of energy engineering. She became our tour guide and assisted us to settle in and really helped a lot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>My mentors where Chris Mbori the Managing Director at <a href=\"http:\/\/eenovators.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Eenovators Limited (opens in a new tab)\">Eenovators Limited<\/a> and Albert. They helped me and made sure I get the best training to become a top energy auditor. I worked with a group of young engineers that know their stuff and they gave me the most out of my time in Kenya at <a href=\"http:\/\/eenovators.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Eenovators (opens in a new tab)\">Eenovators<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I stayed with a Mzee (old man) his name &#8211; David Mbori who made sure I was at work on time safe and well as fed me. I was taken care of with flying colors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to talk about the work we did, but believe me it\u2019s all very technical and very detailed things. I will however say that I used a lot of logging tools and did a lot of site visiting while doing our energy walk throughs and this made me put theory to practice. This was done in style as I had top PPE (personal protective equipment) at <a href=\"http:\/\/eenovators.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Eenovators (opens in a new tab)\">Eenovators<\/a>, so we worked safe and neat .I would like to say thanks to the team at <a href=\"http:\/\/eenovators.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Eenovators (opens in a new tab)\">Eenovators<\/a> for making my stay in Kenya a happy one.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I will now tell you about my social life in Kenya as after all I was a visitor and I wanted to experience everything about being in Kenya. The food was amazing from the ugali to the mboga I can\u2019t lie, I enjoyed every bit of it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The transportation was one that I never got used to but I won&#8217;t lie it was a good experience from matatu to bodaboda this made it real as I was around real Kenyans that loved their county. \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I had some time to go and see the night life and I\u2019m glad to report that I was happy to see what I saw, and I won\u2019t say anymore for as it goes what happens in the club stays in the club. \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I then went to the main city center and saw the beautiful Masaai market and it was a good experience to see the beautiful paintings and beads made by the men and women of Kenya.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I will end with a big thanks to everyone that reads this and say save energy &#8211; switch of the lights.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-1249416434\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Mogatle David Mehlape but you can call me David.
