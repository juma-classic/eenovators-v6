Researchers have been working on developing protein- and dietary fiber-enriched,<br>micronutrient-fortified snacks using extrusion technology to address this issue. Corn, soybean, and<br>chickpea flour have been used as ingredients in these fortified snacks, which have shown promising<br>results in alleviating micronutrient and macronutrient deficiencies among children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market growth and diversification<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The puffed and extruded snacks category has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, with<br>sales approaching $10 billion annually. Consumers are increasingly seeking healthier alternatives to<br>traditional snack products, resulting in a more diverse and dynamic market. Brands like CFAM<br>Technologies, which designs and manufactures world-class food and feed processing equipment, are<br>contributing to this growth by providing innovative solutions for the snack industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key ingredients in nutritional extruded snacks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Legumes: Soybean and chickpeas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Soybean and chickpea are two key ingredients used in the development of nutritional extruded<br>snacks due to their high protein content and essential amino acids. These legumes not only contribute<br>to the overall nutritional value of the snacks but also enhance their flavor and texture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dietary fiber: Guar gum<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Guar gum is an excellent source of dietary fiber, with a high concentration of soluble dietary fiber<br>(75%) and insoluble dietary fiber (7.6%). The inclusion of guar gum in extruded snacks helps increase<br>satiety and prolong gastric emptying time, contributing to the overall health benefits of these products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternative ingredients: Peas, lentils, and chickpeas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some brands are shifting away from traditional corn-based snacks in favor of alternative, nutrient-<br>dense product substrates like peas, lentils, and chickpeas. These ingredients not only provide a<br>unique flavor profile but also offer additional health benefits, such as higher protein content and<br>improved overall nutrition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For relevant conferences and workshops regarding food &amp; feed extrusion, visit<br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.extruafrica.org.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.ExtruAfrica.org.za<\/a>. The next available course is taking place in August 2023, in Kenya. This<br>course will focus on the applications of extrusion for developing countries. It is focused on technical<br>and practical applications of extrusion and presented by international industry expert, Prof Mian Riaz<br>from Texas A&amp;M University.<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-43627115\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In developing countries malnutrition is a significant challenge affecting millions of people, particularlychildren.
