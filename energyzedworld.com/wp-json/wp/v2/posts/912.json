We rarely give thought to what I may call small timers like domestic usage and office usage. If we can embrace energy conservation measures in our offices we stand to make huge collective savings nationally and globally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few measures that require emphasis which I believe if taken to account will boost energy savings greatly in the office environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> <strong>Lighting<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most offices are fitted with old high energy consuming bulbs. These bulbs consume a lot of energy and light quality is also poor. By replacing these bulbs with LED bulbs we stand to save a lot in terms of energy and thus reducing our bills significantly. The initial cost might appear on the high side but these bulbs are more durable and quality of light is superb. Furthermore, while still on lighting, one can also observe that in most offices the light fittings are more than enough. On many instances one can do with half or even a third of the capacity of the light system in place. Very often all the rows of lights are put on simultaneously. This results into wastage which can be avoided.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Electronic gadgets<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most gadgets like desktops, laptops, UPS etc. are most times left on in standby mode. In this state they consume power. It would be logical to inculcate discipline in the office staff so that they switch off these gadgets when not in use to save power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> <strong>Air conditioners or heaters<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I have had the opportunity to work at a station where use of air conditioner was almost mandatory and similarly, at a station where the use of a heater was also crucial during working hours. It was my observation that there was quite a lot of energy wasted by the constant opening of doors and windows. In some cases you could find the air conditioner on and the window(s) also permanently open. Similarly the heater would be on while the door to the office was left wide open. These two scenarios led to a lot of energy being used but alas! We were ignorant, and did not know!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> <strong>Sensors<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly I want to talk about the importance of fitting sensors. Most areas in the office have lights left on throughout the day. On many occasions the office occupant may be out or off duty with the lights left on throughout. By installing e motion or occupancy sensors, a lot of energy would be saved as when the occupant leaves the lights would automatically go off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, the discipline and attitude of the users of energy is essential to reduce energy costs, but above all awareness is paramount. The awareness can be achieved through training of members in energy awareness courses by firms which are competent in this field, for both technical and none technical people.<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-2709537556\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>David Mbori When people talk about energy savings people tend to rush to think about big energy consumers like factories and other big plants.
