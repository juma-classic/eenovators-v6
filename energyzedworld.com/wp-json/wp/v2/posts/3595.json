This technology allows for the efficient processing of various ingredients, including grains,<br>pulses, and animal-sourced ingredients, to create protein-rich and fiber-enhanced formulations. Twin-<br>screw extruders also offer flexibility in adjusting processing parameters and extruder set-up to create<br>diverse snack products without exorbitant capital expenditure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Equipment Innovations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies like CFAM Technologies are continuously innovating to develop new processing<br>equipment that can cater to the growing demand for nutritional and whole grain extruded snacks. By<br>offering a variety of &#8220;clip-on&#8221; modules and ancillary equipment for further processing, such as cutters,<br>formers, filling equipment, drying, toasting, and enrobing, these companies are helping snack<br>manufacturers create diverse and unique products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For relevant conferences and workshops regarding food &amp; feed extrusion, visit<br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.extruafrica.org.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.ExtruAfrica.org.za<\/a>. The next available course is taking place in August 2023, in Kenya. This<br>course will focus on the applications of extrusion for developing countries. It is focused on technical<br>and practical applications of extrusion and presented by international industry expert, Prof Mian Riaz<br>from Texas A&amp;M University.<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-1857983709\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The puffed and extruded snacks category has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, withsales approaching $10 billion annually.
