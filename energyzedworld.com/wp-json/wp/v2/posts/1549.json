As a professional, it gives you an edge to constantly keep yourself updated with these trends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The energy professional Training Survey 2019 Report (<a href=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Training-Survey-2019.pdf\">http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Training-Survey-2019.pdf<\/a>) shows a growing demand for training from energy professionals. This can be attributed to the fact that energy space is a disruptive field with constant changes now and then. Intensive research is being undertaken for example in the battery storage to ensure that homes can still use solar power at night. Solar PV technologies between the last 5-10 years have really changed with increased efficiency. Without the knowledge of these changes a solar PV technician might find themselves recommending an old technology yet, there are more efficient and possibly cheaper alternatives in the market.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some of the training needs in your organization?<\/strong><br><\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-1394853124\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Paul Muhia Data &amp; Energy driven Analyst.
