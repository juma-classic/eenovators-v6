Wind energy comes a close second having risen 22 fold (from\n29,000MW to 539,000MW) from 2001 to 2017. There is no denying that green energy\nhas taken the world by storm. It is the hot topic in energy conversations, and\nfor all the right reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of\nperhaps the world\u2019s greatest pandemic so far, we can\u2019t help but wonder what is\ngoing on in the renewable energy sector and the current and future effects. We\ngot researching and pulled up the latest in the industry. Here, we have broken\nit down for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A plunge in energy equipment supply<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes as no\nsurprise that China is the largest supplier of energy equipment \u2013 particularly\nused for wind and solar installations. We are talking solar panels, wind\nturbines, batteries among other essentials. Thanks to COVID-19, there has been\na widespread shutdown of factories in China that produce these items. This has\nobviously left a huge gap in the demand and supply chain for these equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning\nof March, 2020, two of the leading solar panel suppliers for the US utility\nmarket \u2013 Canadian Solar Inc. and JinkoSolar Holding Co. reported a drop in\ntheir stock prices since the pandemic hit the world.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although China\nis slowly getting back to its feet and increasing production, the short-term\ndisruption effects have been a huge blow to the renewable energy sector. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Challenge in investment<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time\nnow, the clean energy sector has been brimming with a plethora of investment\nopportunities. The expansion and contraction potential ultimately spikes the\nreward opportunity. Some of the investment opportunities to look into, include\nrenewable energy stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, equities\nof energy companies, and the ability to buy commodities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 has\nthrown a few complexities in the renewable energy investment equation.\nCurrently there are threats to the tax credit viability of power purchase\nagreements (PPAs) \u2013 both of which are making it very difficult for investors to\nthrow their monies into renewable projects. Some of them will unfortunately not\nmeet operational deadlines as per the PPAs between developers and electricity\nbuyers. Project deadlines are essential in recovering the full value of\ninvestment tax credit for projects and this has been affected. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bottom line<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 has proved and to be a massive threat to not only the health and lives of people but to the renewable energy space as well. In the face of calamity, the economy takes a beating. But there is a hidden gem of opportunity for those with a positive outlook in life. This is the time to shift focus to local strategies to deal with the crisis once and for all. Governments and authorities should rise to the occasion and champion for local manufacture of wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal equipment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Author Bio<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice Cheptoo is a chemical and process engineer, blogger, and tech writer.
