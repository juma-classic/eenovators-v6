This is opposed to a power source, such as a battery or generator, which produces power. The term may also refer to the power consumed by a circuit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Motors-3.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Motors-3.jpg\" alt=\"Motors 3\" class=\"wp-image-263 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Electrical Loads majorly comprises the following;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> 1 <strong>Resistive Loads<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Resistive loads are loads which consume electrical energy in a sinusoidal manner. This means that the current flow is in time with and directly proportional to the voltage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, it is basically a load that contains no Inductance or Capacitance, just pure Resistance. Therefore, when a resistive load is energized, the current rises instantly to its steady-state value without first rising to a higher value.<br>Includes loads such as incandescent lighting and electrical heaters<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2<strong> Inductive Loads<\/strong><br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>An inductive load is a load that pulls a large amount of current (an inrush current) when first energized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few cycles or seconds, the current \u201csettles down\u201d to a full-load running current.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inductive loads can cause excessive voltages to appear when switched.<br>Examples of inductive loads are motors, transformers, and wound control gear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/transfom.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/transfom.jpg\" alt=\"transfom\" class=\"wp-image-267 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 <strong>Capacitive Loads<\/strong><br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A capacitive load is an AC electrical load in which the current wave reaches its peak before the voltage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms they are loads that capacitance exceeds inductance.<br>Example of a capacitive load is the flash of the camera.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>N\/B: This will help understand the power quality we use in our loads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-3087477944\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Amos Kiprop Energy efficiency is a goal of most industrial firms.
