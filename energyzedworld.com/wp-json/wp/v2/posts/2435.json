The project was granted in 2019 US Cents 7.5\/kWh feed in tariff and the full commissioning set to happen by December 2023 with the Power Purchase Agreement(PPA)  to be negotiated Take or Pay. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The construction of the project is to happen on a 249 Acre roadside land in Kibos, Kisumu County, and the feasibility studies for the same have been completed. The plant will be connected to the new 220KV Kibos substation located in the vicinity. Its estimated first year energy generation is 105.264 MWh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs a Kenyan who has been involved in solar energy for the last 30 years , I am delighted and deeply honored for having been given this opportunity to be involved in such an important project in Kisumu, an area of Kenya which has a great thirst for energy and development. Our dream of turning this delightful town on the tropical shores of Lake Vittoria into a \u201c Solar City\u201d is going to come true.\u00a0 It is very important for Kenya to have many such \u201c solar hotspots,\u201d said Alberto Soprani, Senior VP Africa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cwe are grateful to the Kenya Government for approving this project in Kisumu County that we believe will energize numerous investments and activities, offering an important contribution towards a sustainable development of the region.
