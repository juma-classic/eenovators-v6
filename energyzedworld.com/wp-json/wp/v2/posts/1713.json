A smart meter is an electronic device that records consumption of electric energy in intervals of an hour or less and communicates that information at least daily back to the utility for monitoring and billing. A good example is the eGauge Meter.<\/li>\r\n<li>Clean energy sector employs more than one million people\u00a0in the EU. It also accounts for \u20ac144bn revenue every year.\u00a0<\/li>\r\n<li>The solar energy market alone has created over 175,000 jobs in the United States.<\/li>\r\n<li>Coal is the largest global source of electricity, but only about 1\/3 of the energy from the average coal power plant makes it to customers in the form of electricity.<\/li>\r\n<li>A single wind turbine can create enough energy to power as many as 300 homes.<\/li>\r\n<li>Only about 10% of the energy used in a single lightbulb is used to create light, the rest is used to create heat.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=flourescent+light+bulb&amp;crid=1BJVRXWIZNTWD&amp;sprefix=floures,aps,378&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_7&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=energyzedwo05-20&amp;linkId=a5d43579c6efb731b83134a30727475d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Fluorescent light bulbs (opens in a new tab)\">Fluorescent light bulbs<\/a>, use about 80% less energy in total than standard bulbs.<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=led+bulbs&amp;crid=2Y2A1WKRGYB5J&amp;sprefix=led+bulb,aps,1152&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_8&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=energyzedwo05-20&amp;linkId=4725f8f70bffd6bb1dd05452906304f0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"LED bulbs (opens in a new tab)\">LED bulbs<\/a> are the most efficient light bulbs and use about 90% less energy than other bulbs.

That is the equivalent carbon emission of 670<br \/>coal power plants in a year!<\/li>\r\n<li>Only 5% of energy drawn from a phone charger is used to charge the phone. Chargers use energy as long as they are plugged into a power source so 95% of the energy is wasted.<\/li>\r\n<li>Approximately 30 percent of the energy used in most buildings today is either unnecessary or used inefficiently.<\/li>\r\n<li>Every year, 171 Kgs of CO2 is released into the atmosphere just by leaving on unused lights around our homes and offices.<\/li>\r\n<li>About 30% of an average household energy bill is made up wasted energy.<\/li>\r\n<li>Every minute, enough sunlight hits the earth\u2019s surface to supply the entire world\u2019s energy demands for a year.<\/li>\r\n<li>While they still don\u2019t make up a significant amount of the global energy resources, solar and wind production rates have more than tripled since 2008.<\/li>\r\n<li>It costs just $0.47 per year to charge an iPhone 6. It takes 49 times as much energy to charge a desktop computer and 72 times as much energy to power a flat screen television.<\/li>\r\n<li>The microwave is the most energy efficient appliance in most kitchens. It uses one-third of the wattage that the average oven uses.<\/li>\r\n<li>There is a constant development of smart technologies that bring intelligence in systems like HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), or just in the way electricity is distributed. This helps in making sure appliances, equipment or facilities operate only when<br \/>it\u2019s crucial.
