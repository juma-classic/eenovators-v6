The greatest legacy one can live and leave, is to leave the world a better place than one found it, for the coming generations. WED provides the opportunity to practically demonstrate social responsibility. To participate as an organization involves creating a plan with ideas of how to conserve energy both at work and at home. These ideas may then be implemented during World Energy Day Celebrations period. There is no limit to what could be done and some ideas may include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Sending out energy conservation messages to different stakeholders<\/li><li>Posting energy conservation messages on different digital platforms<\/li><li>Wishing customers and staff a Happy World Energy Day week<\/li><li>Putting up Happy World Energy Day messages in the office<\/li><li>Educating customers and staff on energy saving and environmental protection matters<\/li><li>Undertaking charitable CSR activities in the community<\/li><li>Brainstorming on how to conserve energy in the organization<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Get creative about how to raise awareness of energy conservation. The more creative the better! WED activities will be recognized and published by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aepea.co.ke\/aepea\/\">AEPEA<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/eenovators.com\/\">Eenovators<\/a> that are coordinating the local celebrations.

The Student Energy Innovation Challenge is on, and participants are in high gear towards the development of innovative energy conservation concepts to provide sustainable solutions. The challenge brings together young people from the region, currently in various institutions including universities and technical institutions, as they submit their innovative energy solutions. Viable ideas that make it to the shortlist will be exhibited during the WED Conference 2018. Their energy projects will be showcased either as models, computer simulations or actual designs and will be scrutinized by an eminent panel of judges with business acumen, innovation prowess and energy expertise. The top three projects will walk away with prizes that include internships, incubation, and commercialization of ideas, shopping vouchers, holiday experiences and cash prizes. Support young people <a href=\"http:\/\/wed.eenovators.com\/index.php\/sponsorship\/\">here<\/a> as they immerse themselves in energy sustainability by cheering them on, providing in kind support, opportunities for training, mentoring and business coaching, as well as financial resources towards the WED Student Challenge Success!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participating in the WED Celebrations 2018 will set apart those who give lip service to giving back to society from those who will stand up to take the bold step to demonstrate true value. The world is waiting for us to localizing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG7) towards collaboration to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Delivering on this objective is not rocket science.
