This means that, through Bluetooth connectivity, you are able to log and monitor measurements without being close to the equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clamp meter is small and can be easily operated with one hand when switching to the different frequencies. The portability factor here is also made easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluke 376 has multiple functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>It can measure AC up to 1000 Volts and DC also up to 1000 Volts.<\/li><li>It can also measure up to 1000 Amps DC and AC.<\/li><li>Measures MilliVolts DC<\/li><li>It does capacitance and resistance<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The device also has proprietary inrush measurement technology which has the ability to filter out noise hence capturing motor starting current exactly as the circuit protection sees it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clamp meter works with a set of batteries and therefore you do not have to look for a separate source of power to operate and you can use any Bluetooth device for your Bluetooth display.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Fluke-376-FC-NIST-Traceable-Calibration-Certificate\/dp\/B01CFXIMOU\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=iflex+ac&amp;qid=1575447136&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=energyzedwo05-20&amp;linkId=5fbab19dae5eabecc3404a1f1e296c30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"iFlex (opens in a new tab)\">iFlex<\/a> cable which expands the measurement range to 2500 A AC. The cables also provides increased display flexibility with its ability to measure large sized conductors and improved wire access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluke 376 also comes with a TPAK magnetic hanging strap which is durable and has a very strong gripping ability. These straps enables you to hang the device on hooks, nails etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering whether the device will work well if you buy it from the United States and use it overseas. It works perfectly well everywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, with the accuracy and the fact that Fluke 376 Clamp Meter is easy to operate. I would recommend this to any electrician out here, whether you are an industrial or a commercial electrician, this tool here is perfect for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This product here is great quality!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B017OVC2QM\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B017OVC2QM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ruthcarol-20&amp;linkId=6445025853bae30dd3e778ebbd43574a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buy Here<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Fluke 376 FC Unboxing\" width=\"1080\" height=\"810\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IVqUqIiR3oc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" class=\"lazyload\" data-load-mode=\"1\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-3469450407\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Ruth Carol Atieno Fluke 376 FC Clamp Meter is an advanced tool, with a wide range of specification, used by electricians to safely and efficiently troubleshoot for industrial and commercial buildings.
