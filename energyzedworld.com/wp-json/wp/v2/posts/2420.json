The current share of renewable energy to <a href=\"http:\/\/ogpeafrica.com\/newsarticle.aspx?newsitem=MTA2OA==\">the grid is 93%,<\/a> a great indication that Kenya is right on track to achieving its goal. 2019 played a crucial role in catapulting Kenya&#8217;s success in tapping into the renewables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time, Kenya made it\ninto the <a href=\"http:\/\/global-climatescope.org\/results\">top five global clean energy\nranking<\/a>, backed by the higher contribution of solar, wind and\ngeothermal capacity into the energy mix. Let us take a deeper look at the\nmilestones achieved and what the future holds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Winds of Change<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ltwp.co.ke\/inauguration-2019\/\">Lake Turkana Wind Farm<\/a> was launched on July 19<sup>th<\/sup> 2019. It is <strong>Africa&#8217;s largest wind power project<\/strong> located in Loiyangalani District Marsabit County.

The wind farm contributes\n12% to the grid boosting share of the renewables. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;The Lake Turkana Wind project was a major\nmilestone in the wind energy sector and most certainly not the last.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;In\nAugust 2019 Meru County Government <a href=\"https:\/\/renewablesnow.com\/news\/windlab-eurus-sign-mou-for-80-mw-hybrid-energy-park-in-kenya-667805\/\">entered\ninto a MOU<\/a> with leading global renewable energy developers for the. <strong>development of Africa&#8217;s first large scale\nhybrid project.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Meru County Energy Park is a hybrid\nwind, solar PV and battery storage project. It will provide up to 80MW of\nsustainable renewable energy, consisting of up to 20 wind turbines and more\nthan 40,000 solar panels and battery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The construction of the energy park\nofficially <a href=\"https:\/\/constructionreviewonline.com\/2020\/01\/construction-of-meru-county-energy-park-kicks-off\/\">kicked\noff early 2020<\/a>, a clear indication that those quiescent days in wind\nenergy are over. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A\nNew Perspective of Sunshine<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solar potential in Kenya is enormous with the equator running right through the middle of Kenya and much of the country is arid and semi-arid.
