Well, it\u2019s not yet 2030 and in our country Kenya, this is already becoming a reality for most of the population. The percentage of people already being affected by water stress is likely to increase exponentially. This is due to effects of global warming that are being experienced, and the constantly increasing population. Therefore, unless drastic changes on how we utilize our water resources are made, it will not be a lie to say that tough days are ahead of us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, dwindling water levels in our dams has stopped being news. Dry taps and constant water rationing have become a norm in our homes and even places of work. Drillers are forced to drill deeper as the existing bore holes are running dry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the story for some people living in the Karen area in Nairobi, as the Ground Water Levels have gone down. The cases only reinforce the undeniable truth that we as a country need to look into sustainable ways to manage and utilize our water resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"630\" height=\"350\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/NDAKAINI-MEASURING-STICK.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1370 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/NDAKAINI-MEASURING-STICK.jpg 630w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/NDAKAINI-MEASURING-STICK-300x167.jpg 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 630px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 630\/350;\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mismanagement of water in our country occurs in the places you would least expect. Places you think that people would know better and where there is evidence that they understand our water stress situation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take for example our learning institutions; Universities, Secondary and Primary Schools. These are the places where people are thought to be taught on ways to better the world.  Yet the mismanaging of water going on is just unthinkable. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Type of toilets<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The types of toilets in place are still those that flush about 7- 9 liters of water down the drain. A single person washing their hands at the tap uses nearly 4 liters of water . Put into consideration the size of the population.You will see that we have a big water wastage problem. In addition to this, there are always leaking taps, toilets, and pipes that go unnoticed. Okay\u2026 maybe people notice but just don&#8217;t care. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Water usage by students<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also ignorance on the part of the students about how they use water. Since they don\u2019t pay the bills, they are hardly conscious or cautious about how they use water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/1421966276679-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1371 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/1421966276679-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/1421966276679-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/1421966276679-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/1421966276679.jpg 1000w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 683px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 683\/1024;\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Where do we start to correct the error of water mismanagement? The best place to start would be at our learning institutions. We will have hope that the lessons there will always take the lessons back to the society at large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sensitization of students<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sensitizing the students on the importance of water management through:  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Addition of a relevant subject in their curriculum<\/li><li>Having workshops held by entities that are concerned with water management such as<a href=\"https:\/\/eenovators.com\/\"> Eenovators<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.endustrialsupport.com\">Endustrial Support<\/a> at the schools. <\/li><li>Formation of Policies by the government towards this goal could also be beneficial. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Water management policies<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine if we had policies that govern the construction of buildings to attain water savings? Policies that would govern what type of toilets, showers, and taps were acceptable for commercial buildings. Policies to ensure that pipe network systems are checked regularly to mitigate any leakages? Wouldn\u2019t this make the difference we are all looking for towards water savings?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"846\" height=\"480\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1375 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/1.jpg 846w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/1-300x170.jpg 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/1-768x436.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 846px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 846\/480;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These measures may seem to be unattainable to many or even costly. Although, these conservation  measures have been tried before and have worked. The initial cost of implementation maybe high but the payback time is guaranteed. Water bills get lower. The long-term benefit of having attained proper management of water in our country as a whole, makes it all the more worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we continue to reflect about the water situation in this country, we need to reflect on the words of Niall Fitzgerland \u201cSustainability is here to stay or we not be\u201d, These deep words only affirm to us that our only option in our constantly changing world is to seek sustainable ways to use and manage our water if we are to live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pherry Angela<\/strong> is currently an undergraduate student at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
