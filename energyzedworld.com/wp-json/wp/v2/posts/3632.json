Solar PV is likely going to be the first choice renewable energy source you will look into. This is due to the technological advancements in the solar industry, which have seen the cost of purchase reduce and made it more readily available in the market. We are going to look into some of the components that make up a standalone solar PV system that you may get on a solar PV system quote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Solar photovoltaic panels<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the main component of a solar PV system, as it converts sunlight into electricity through cells made of semiconductor material. PV cells connected in series make up a solar panel. To generate significant currents and power level, a number of solar panels are connected in parallel and series to form an array. Depending on the specifications, solar panels are available in 12V or 24V direct current (DC).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/SOL1.png\" alt=\"Source\" class=\"wp-image-3635 lazyload\" width=\"388\" height=\"277\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 388px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 388\/277;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/(https:\/\/energyresearch.ucf.edu\/consumer\/solar-technologies\/solar-electricity-basics\/cells-modules-panels-and-arrays\/)\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"(https:\/\/energyresearch.ucf.edu\/consumer\/solar-technologies\/solar-electricity-basics\/cells-modules-panels-and-arrays\/)\">So<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/(https:\/\/energyresearch.ucf.edu\/consumer\/solar-technologies\/solar-electricity-basics\/cells-modules-panels-and-arrays\/\" data-type=\"URL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">urce <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inverter<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The inverter converts the generated and stored DC current to AC current. New systems use hybrid inverters, which have a micro inverter and a battery charger in one unit. This allows solar panels, batteries, and grid electricity to interact as a unit, rather than working separately.<br>It also eliminates the need for a conventional battery charge controller unit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/SOL2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3636 lazyload\" width=\"397\" height=\"232\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 397px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 397\/232;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanenergyreviews.info\/blog\/what-is-a-hybrid-inverter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Source <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Battery<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This store electricity generated by the solar panels so that it can be used in the evening or when electricity generation is low. The battery setup is sized using the size of load requirement and autonomy. Autonomy is the number of days the system will work without electricity generation from solar, general recommended autonomy days are 2- 5 days. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alternative-energy-tutorials.com\/solar-power\/how-to-size-a-solar-power-system.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are four main types of battery technologies that are paired with the system, Lead acid batteries, lithium ion, Nickel based batteries and flow batteries. Application depends on the system requirements and budget. Lithium ion battery being the most commonly used since its able to store large amounts of power in small amount of space while being able to discharge almost all the stored energy. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.solarreviews.com\/blog\/types-of-solar-batteries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Source <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Balance of systems<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not a component it entails, other hardware components that are used during the system setup , the mounting system for the solar panels, the wiring and connectors used to connect all of the solar system components, lightning protection to help protect your solar PV system from lightning, and a solar monitoring system to monitor the performance of the system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The specific solar PV system for your home or office will depend on different factors, including the physical location and size of the build for panel installation, the amount of solar irradiance at your building, your load requirement (the equipment that you need to power), and your budget.<br>To determine a suitable solar PV system for your site, you will need an expert to conduct a site and load requirement survey before settling on a system.
