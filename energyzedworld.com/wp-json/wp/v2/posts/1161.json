We made huge strides forward in creating a better working energy management environment. This is significant for the continent as with the right energy management policies, the world could achieve up to 40% emission cuts that are needed to attain its climate change goals without the use of any new technology. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually about 8% higher than what shifting to renewable energy would cut in terms of emissions. Energy management is therefore a subject that requires focused attention, and below are some 5 key things that happened in 2018 and will influence the way 2019 shapes up:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Leadership at Both AEPEA and SAEEC<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The Association of Energy Professionals Eastern Africa (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aepea.co.ke\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Association of Energy Professionals Eastern Africa<\/a> (AEPEA) voted in a new executive committee to steer its operations for the years 2018 to 2021. The new AEPEA President is Eng. Simon Ngure. Simon is an astute leader with over 35 years experience in the energy industry. He has previously served as the Vice President of AEPEA and was one of the founding members of this local chapter. He also doubles up as one of the Directors at Kengen, Kenya\u2019s biggest energy generating company. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saeeconfed.org.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The South African Energy Efficiency Confederation  (opens in a new tab)\">The South African Energy Efficiency Confederation <\/a>also elected a new executive board that will later select a President for their chapter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With\nnew leadership in place in both these two pivotal energy associations, we expect\nrenewed vigor in the promotion of energy management activities in Africa. Great\nleadership is what has been missing in the energy management space in Africa to\ncreate the needed change. The new leadership teams will work with the existing\nsystems to create the right environment in terms of policy development,\nnetworking and awareness, that is key to the growth of the energy management\nmarket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Chapter Formation Activities in Uganda, Nigeria and Ghana<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There\nwas important progress in formation of Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) local\nchapters in Uganda, Nigeria and Ghana. The necesary meetings have already been\nheld and it is anticipated that before the end of 2019, these three countries\nwill have their very own AEE chapters in their respective countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new chapters, have heightened the expectations of stakeholders, with a lot of activities anticipated to be coming forth from these countries in line with energy management. Nigerians have already successfully conducted a Certified Energy Manager training programme, in addition to two other energy efficiency courses. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The African continent is in need of more energy professionals and specifically more energy managers who will be instrumental in providing direction and efficient energy management. Most African countries have no human professional capacity to effectively manage energy, and this creates a gap in the bid towards changing the continent\u2019s energy use and management. With these local AEE chapters, more energy managers will be professionally certified and released to deliver effectively in their different spaces of influence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Three Key Energy Management Conferences<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There were three energy conferences held in 2018 that were of key importance. This began with the <a href=\"https:\/\/aee-tunisia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"AEE - Tunisia chapter (opens in a new tab)\">AEE &#8211; Tunisia chapter<\/a> having an opening ceremony to celebrate their chapter formation. This year, the 2019 theme for the Tunisia Energy Conference has been: Job Opportunities &amp; Women Empowerment in the energy sector, addressing a subject that requires attention. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Kenya, The <a href=\"http:\/\/wed.eenovators.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"World Energy Day Conference (opens in a new tab)\">World Energy Day Conference<\/a> was conducted by AEPEA and Eenovators with the theme: The Future of Energy in Africa: The Sustainability Agenda. The two day conference was held on 25 and 26th of October 2018 with more than 100 delegates attending from across Africa and hosting key note speakers from around the continent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/46463200_2137447672965895_4000521840177971200_o-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1162 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/46463200_2137447672965895_4000521840177971200_o-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/46463200_2137447672965895_4000521840177971200_o-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/46463200_2137447672965895_4000521840177971200_o-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/46463200_2137447672965895_4000521840177971200_o.jpg 2048w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/683;\" \/><figcaption>World Energy Day Participants pose for a group photo with Chapter President Simon Ngure (Seated Far right)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally\nthe South African Energy Efficiency conference took place in November 2018 in\nJohannesburg with the theme on Climate Change. This was the 13th time the South\nAfrican Energy Efficiency Confederation was hosting this conference and\nimportant energy discussions continued to be held.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In\n2019 we expect each of these chapters to hold their energy conferences to\npromote awareness and networking in the energy management space. The Tunisia\nchapter has just successfully concluded their Conference called Wenercon in\nFebruary 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nWorld Energy Day Kenya Confernce is expected in October 2019 with the theme:\nEnergy Sustainability in Africa: Unlocking the Energy and Climate Change\nEquation. We expect the South African Energy Efficiency confederation to host\ntheir 14th annual conference in November as per tradition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Training License Given to Energy Training Foundation in Partnership With AEPEA<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The sole training license for the Africa and Indian Ocean Island region was awarded to the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Energy Training Foundation (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/energytrainingfoundation.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Training Foundation<\/a>. In Kenya, the Association of Energy Professionals Eastern Africa are mandated to conduct training in the Kenyan region in partnership with the Energy Training Foundation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot more Certification Training happening across Africa this year and this will serve to build the much needed professional capacity. &nbsp;Seychelles has already conducted a Certified Energy Auditor course in February 2019 with other African countries earmarked to conduct more courses. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenya is planning to conduct a Certified Energy Manager course in April 2019 while Nigeria is planning to run a certification course before mid year. The energy professional statistics are worth taking note of as ther is already a worldwide shortage of about 71% of energy professionals. About 48% of the current energy professionals globally are going to retire in the next decade. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acquiring these certifications will open up opportunities for the certified experts not only in Africa but worldwide to address the existing and emerging energy needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/ENTF-AEPEA-partnership-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1163 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/ENTF-AEPEA-partnership-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/ENTF-AEPEA-partnership-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/ENTF-AEPEA-partnership-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/768;\" \/><figcaption>Yolanda de lange (right), Chris Mbori and Eng.
