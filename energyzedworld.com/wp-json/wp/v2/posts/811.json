Monitoring is also essential to setting reduction targets in water use and it forms integral part of an Energy Management System especially for high water users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology calculate pulses from the water meter, and sends an immediate alert and analysis to mobile devices or to a PC where one can see a graphical presentation of the water usage (see figure below).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is done by installing real time loggers\/monitors on the main and sub-meters, allowing one to isolate usage, for example, by consumer, building, department, process or tenant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1112\" height=\"619\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_20170123_085808_807.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-812 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_20170123_085808_807.jpg 1112w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_20170123_085808_807-300x167.jpg 300w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_20170123_085808_807-768x428.jpg 768w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/IMG_20170123_085808_807-1024x570.jpg 1024w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1112px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1112\/619;\" \/><figcaption> Figure 1: sample graphical presentation of water usage using a real time water monitor <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the benefit of monitoring your water?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>You will be able to explain variations in water use, such as increased production or seasonality factors.<\/li><li>You will be able to understand potential risks and impacts associated with a company\u2019s water use.<\/li><li>You will identify inefficiencies and leaks hence conserve water and save on costs.<\/li><li>Identify opportunities for water savings and set reduction targets.<\/li><li>Reduce risks associated with disruptions in water supplies or increase in cost of water.<\/li><li>For companies\/factories, residential owners, hotels and restaurants, by reducing water cost, you increase you margins and increase income.<\/li><li>In cases where one is monitoring water from a tank using technologies such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techwatersolutions.com\/tank-mkononi-monitoring-system-1\">Tank Mkononi<\/a>&nbsp; to one is able to monitor water levels in their tanks and reservoirs from any location, using their mobile phones and when water levels go below a programmed threshold, the system sends a low water level SMS alarm to a mobile number (s).<\/li><li>By monitoring water in your tank you able to curb exploitation by water suppliers while also ensuring you have consistent water and ensuring your tanks never run out of water.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Water monitoring empowers one to take charge of their water management and works towards prudent use.
