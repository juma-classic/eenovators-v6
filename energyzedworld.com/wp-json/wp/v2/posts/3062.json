All is not lost, this regulation provides a means to recognize and regularize ESCO\u2019s in Kenya which is a step towards compliance and mitigation of issues arising within the contractual framework.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How would this work?<\/em> Once incorporated into the Regulations, the amendments will improve compliance levels leading to the following highlighted benefits;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>ESCO\u2019S will create a pipeline of projects and finances, which will mostly be through foreign direct investments leading to the creation of high productivity and more jobs.<\/li><li>Licensing of energy managers for facilities will build capacity for facilities to have a better understanding of energy efficiency, adopt the best energy management practices, and act as advisory to management on implementation of energy efficient projects.<\/li><li>The increment of audit period from 3 years to 4 years will give facilities adequate time to measure, verify, document, report, and appreciate the importance of carrying out audits.<\/li><li>Introduction of the requirement to define performance benchmarks will help companies strive towards meeting targets, to benefit from the White and Green Certificate markets.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Alternatives to The Proposed Regulations<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-regulation is the considered alternative to implementing the regulations. It would require non-government agencies or associations to come together and work towards improving their trade, for the benefit of the energy sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\" type=\"a\"><li>Energy auditors, who should be licensed by the Authority, shall be licensing themselves, through a professional association.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, no such association currently exists with the frameworks for professional accreditation for auditors and energy firms. &nbsp;The two that come closest &#8211; Association of Energy Professionals of Eastern Africa focuses on offering training while Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) unites industrialists and has no mandatory registration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>The facilities should form or have an association that can assist with checks and balances, with measures where there is a mandatory requirement to conduct the audits and eliminate the concept of autonomy that may be present within such associations.<\/li><li>The ESCO\u2019s will also have to form a self-regulating mechanism that will help them work well with other facilities. There must be regulatory tools to ensure a fair level playing field between the ESCO\u2019s and the facilities.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/3.png.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3066 lazyload\" width=\"375\" height=\"296\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 375px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 375\/296;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It simply cannot be emphasized enough that; ESCO\u2019s will have the technical capacity, knowledge and the financial ability to invest in the implementation of recommended saving measures (ECM\u2019s) provided in audit reports on a larger scale eliminating the constraint faced by most facilities to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ESCO services are necessary and efficiency is important now more than ever. It may not possible to achieve the projected benefits without having a regulation in place as a step to increase the number of accredited ESCO\u2019s in Kenya. The overall energy consumption, costs and carbon emissions will reduce significantly upon implementation of ESCO\u2019s in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating awareness on the benefits of recognizing and accrediting ESCO\u2019s by all stakeholders in the Energy sector in Kenya would generate the visibility necessary to drive the agenda for energy efficiency and conservation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eenovators has partnered with Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH for (i)DPPP- We for food (WE4F): Building ESCO Models for Promotion of Food Security through Water and Energy Management with a Focus on Youth Empowerment- the WESCO model which creates an \u2018operating system&#8217; for energy and water services, processes and contract templates needed to deliver energy and water efficiency projects to the food sector industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Partners in this project are;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.epconnect.energy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>EnergyPro Ltd (EPConnect)<\/strong> <\/a>based in the U.K, providing its innovative solution to energy efficiency projects through the &#8216;ESCO in a Box Model&#8217;.
