It absorbs most of the Sun&#8217;s ultraviolet radiation. It contains high concentration of ozone (O3) and is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, from approximately 15 to 35 kilometers (9.3 to 21.7 mi) above Earth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"602\" height=\"362\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/image-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1642 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/image-8.png 602w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/image-8-300x180.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 602px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 602\/362;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What destroys the Ozone layer?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozone depletion is caused by the release of chemical compounds containing gaseous chlorine or bromine from industry and other human activities. The thinning is most pronounced in the Polar Regions, especially over Antarctica.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozone depletion is a major environmental problem because it increases the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches Earth\u2019s surface, which in turn causes a lot of damage to plants and animals alike.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What emissions from human activities lead to ozone depletion?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientific studies indicate that the cause of ozone layer depletion is human activity, and specifically, human-made chemicals that contain chlorine or bromine. When these gases get to the stratosphere, they cause depletion of the ozone layer. The greatest ozone depleting substances include;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)<\/strong><br>The most extensively common ozone-depleting substance because it attributes to more than 80% of overall ozone depletion. It was used as a coolant in home appliances like freezers, refrigerators and air conditioners in both buildings and cars that were manufactured before to 1995. This substance is usually contained in dry cleaning agents, hospital sterilants, and industrial solvents. The substance is also used in foam products like mattresses and cushions..<\/li><li><strong>Carbon tetrachloride<\/strong><br> Carbon tetrachloride is used in selected fire extinguishers and solvents.<\/li><li><strong>Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)<\/strong><br> These have over the years served in place of Chlorofluorocarbons. They are not as<br> harmful as CFCs to ozone layer.<\/li><li><strong>Methyl chloroform.<\/strong><br> These are commonly used in industries for cold cleaning, vapor degreasing, chemical<br> processing, adhesives and some aerosols.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The production and consumption of all principal halogen source gases by human activities are regulated worldwide under the Montreal Protocol.<br> https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Montreal_Protocol<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if the Ozone layer was missing?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"241\" height=\"241\" data-src=\"http:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/image-9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1643 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/image-9.png 241w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/image-9-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/image-9-80x80.png 80w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 241px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 241\/241;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Without the Ozone layer in place, radiation from the sun would reach earth directly, damaging the DNA of plants and animals (Including humans). Skin cancer rates would be on the rise. (Source: NASA).<br> https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/topics\/earth\/features\/world_avoided.html<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human health, plants, marine life, animals and even materials like plastics, wood, fabrics, rubber are massively affected by too much ultraviolet radiation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within days of the ozone layer&#8217;s disappearance, many plants would die. The intensity of the sun&#8217;s radiation would make photosynthesis (a process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth) impossible. Without plants, the food chain would collapse. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Herbivores would starve. Omnivores and carnivores could feed off their bodies for some time, but their food supply would dwindle causing extinction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can we do to protect the ozone layer?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the things we can do to solve the ozone depletion problem;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Resist from using pesticides &#8211; Pesticides are useful chemicals we use to rid our<br>\nfarms of pests and weeds, but they contribute enormously to ozone layer<br>\ndepletion. Instead of pesticides, apply natural methods. Weed your farm<br>\nmanually and use alternative eco-friendly chemicals to alleviate pests.<\/li><li>Car-pooling and discouraging too much use of private vehicles -These vehicles<br>\nemit a lot of greenhouse gases that eventually form smog, a catalyst in the<br>\ndepletion of ozone layer.<\/li><li>Use environmentally friendly cleaning products &#8211; most household cleaning<br>\nproducts are loaded with harsh chemicals that find their way into the<br>\natmosphere, eventually contributing to degradation of the ozone layer. Use<br>\nnatural and environmentally friendly cleaning products to arrest this situation.<\/li><\/ol>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-2976802411\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Karen Thuranira Every now and then, you find your body yearning for a little sunlight.
