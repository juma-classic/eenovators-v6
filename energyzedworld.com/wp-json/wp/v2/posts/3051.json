In the United States alone, ESCO-delivered projects delivered savings amounting to up to 1% of all energy consumed in commercial buildings in 2012 (Carvallo, Murphy, Stuart, Larsen, &amp; Goldman, 2019). The data collected in this country alone should be enough to highlight the magnitude of the potential available just through the ESCO model not just for energy savings, but as a viable business model capable of employing a significant section of the population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is, however, crucial to first understand what an Energy Service Company is and the implications of this model. An Energy Service Company is a company that provides Energy-Efficiency-Related services to other companies and organizations through a performance contracting approach (Carvallo, Murphy, Stuart, Larsen, &amp; Goldman, 2019). This performance contracting approach essentially guarantees energy savings and their resulting cost savings to the client and the ESCO\u2019s compensation draws from the performance of the project in a pre-determined way. These performance contracts draw from the Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) business model which involves long term contracts between ESCO\u2019s and clients that allow the client to fund significantly large energy efficiency projects, onsite energy generation, and other energy projects without having to incur up-front costs (Carvallo, Murphy, Stuart, Larsen, &amp; Goldman, 2019).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the description of how ESCO\u2019s work and how the whole model holds up from a business perspective, it is evident that this process is a significantly data-intensive undertaking. The underlying concept that validates this model as a business relies on being able to measure the energy performance before and after the application of the energy project. This need makes energy monitoring and analytics a crucial element of the whole process (Augustins, Jaunzems, Rochas, &amp; Kamendersb, 2018). Various approaches exist for energy monitoring and analytics. However, this article will focus on the Eagles Energy Management Portal and how its various modules present a viable approach for measuring, recording, and analyzing data (Eenovators Ltd, 2021).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Data Continuity<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The approaches taken through this online platform provide a complete package with regards to data continuity without impeding the platform\u2019s ability to control the amount of data it stores. This is possible through a proprietary data management approach that draws from expertise both on the data science front and the immense experience and expertise from energy engineers and auditors in the development team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"937\" height=\"816\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/1.jpg.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3053 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/1.jpg.png 937w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/1.jpg-480x418.png 480w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 937px, 100vw\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 937px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 937\/816;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, the snapshot from the platform shows data collected by the platform from 1<sup>st<\/sup> June 2019 to 31<sup>st<\/sup> March 2021, a period spanning a little under 3 years (Eenovators Ltd, 2021).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Data Reporting<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform provides the possibility for data reporting drawing not just from the team\u2019s experience with various data science approaches, but from the team\u2019s vast knowledge in the field of energy management, energy training, and energy auditing for a vast variety of industries across Africa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"935\" height=\"598\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/2.jpg.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3054 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/2.jpg.png 935w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/2.jpg-480x307.png 480w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 935px, 100vw\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 935px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 935\/598;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"982\" height=\"618\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/3.jpg.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3055 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/3.jpg.png 982w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/3.jpg-980x617.png 980w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/3.jpg-480x302.png 480w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 982px, 100vw\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 982px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 982\/618;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The availability of constant reports provides a viable tracking mechanism for energy consumption allowing for the availability of back-stopped data crucial in providing the client with vital information on the various sections considered for energy management approaches. Clients are more at ease when they can identify where the energy purchased goes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Specialized tools<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eagles Platform has in-built specialized tools to handle energy performance analytics drawing from guidelines prescribed by the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocols as well as the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) to provide a verifiable performance outlook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"669\" data-src=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/4.jpg-1024x669.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3056 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/4.jpg-980x640.png 980w, https:\/\/energyzedworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/4.jpg-480x313.png 480w\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/669;\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform can apply regressive analytics both simple multiple linear across selected sections of the data collected by the former to provide insights into energy performance as prescribed by the AEE. The models developed by the system are a crucial precursor to measurement and verification procedures crucial in determining the magnitude of savings achieved from energy efficiency projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The performance analytics section of the platform provides a multitude of tools that cover more than what the ESCO model requires and dives a little deeper to provide both parties with analytics crucial to assuring both parties within the project of its straightforward nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eagles Platform\u2019s developers are also working on even more specialised tools with a special interest in the measurement and verification process to provide an end to end solution for the most crucial section of the ESCO model. This module will draw from the platform\u2019s performance analytics tool among other available specialized tools to provide clients with an open, verifiable, and robust tool crucial to increasing the possibility that clients will trust this new but crucial model for ensuring energy management is a win-win for all parties involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eenovators Ltd &nbsp;is working in collaboration with four strategic partners <a href=\"https:\/\/enso-impact.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ENSO IMPACT LIMITED<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epconnect.energy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ENERGYPRO LIMITED<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.life-skills.co.ke\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LIFESKILLS LIMITED<\/a>, &nbsp;and <a href=\"https:\/\/iepa.org.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(IEPA) INSTITUTE OF ENERGY PROFFESSIONALS AFRICA<\/a> and are currently engaged by GIZ (<em>the German Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH<\/em>) in an exciting energy management project that cuts across various aspects of the same through a fund dubbed the \u201cWater and Energy for Food.\u201d The program cuts across the entire spectrum of energy management from training, through audits, all the way to the ESCO model in specialized packaging in the form of the \u201cESCO in a Box\u201d approach.
