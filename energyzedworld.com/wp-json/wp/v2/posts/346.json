Lighting offers the best opportunity for us <a href=\"http:\/\/http:\/\/www.conserve-energy-future.com\/various-ways-to-go-green.php\">to be green<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So how do we then go green in our lighting systems?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Rush for the LED\u2019s Retrofit and Relamp<br \/><\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You see there are these lighting technologies we are so used to, the yellow incandescent bulbs that get so hot. Or the white spiral bulbs that look like ice cream (CFL\u2019s) or even the long delicate fluorescent tubes that take ages to come on and flicker thereafter to your annoyance.

And it\u2019s the easiest thing to do, way easier than switching your TV on. As efficient as your lighting systems might be, it makes no sense to have lights on when no one&#8217;s around. Turn out lights in rooms or parts of the house where no one is. Teach your family and friends about it too and it will become second nature after breathing. If possible, practice switching off your lights whenever you don\u2019t need them.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><em><strong>Just get Green Energy<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Install solar power systems to supply your lighting energy.

Purpose to include clean energy into your power mix. You will save so much on electricity bills to a point of shock.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><em><strong>Make use of Daylight<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There is no need to have lights on during the day, for what exactly?
