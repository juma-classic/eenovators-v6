Ransom, Joshi, &amp; Nash (2004) categorise these expectations as a range that relies heavily on the sigma six approach for understanding through the Kano analysis. The Kano model classifies these customer expectations into delighters, satisfiers, and dissatisfiers.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/e8tuDrnmJug05Ypvg4iGtVfYbRIaumOqAUecj9YEVaAFktvC9I2z_I4PiVPNd89bE6-9lB2PN6m3RoBGabVgYhTZYZy3x6AgPRlBy6aOEZxxOEUDbPm3dSLu2UoUtZUFl0ODkf-wQ747gHhn1A\" alt=\"G:\\__High as a kite\\adobestock_69882312_customer_expectation_service_survey_barometer_fmt.png\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Clients in the energy field draw from a variety of industries. As such, the nature of this interaction means clients expect delighters, satisfiers, and dissatisfies in their interaction with energy management companies. This article will focus on dissatisfiers as contributors to the building blocks for a working relationship between clients and proprietors in the energy management space.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dissatisfiers are the essential expectations one has when interacting with a business. Other authors describe them as fundamental requirements a client expects as part of the service package. For instance, a client buying a vehicle expects them to have brakes. The absence of brakes would probably mean the business will lose clients both literally and figuratively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/OdU5gdWlU8XUyepZQeJ9A52Hco696dJ3OrIFDQw_XAb50yTpHaQ7TmZOawoTnuFHaEalYZTSrLGDt31_ySLmzmjOwTBybQQ0IphTqIvxQCgpACFjUwmp9Oxs6GoS9jV7s01ajGHKqMcAc9Yqwg\" alt=\"G:\\__High as a kite\\brake_cartoon(2).jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In energy management, an instance would be a reduction in consumption. A client expects a decrease in consumption from interactions with an energy management company. The absence of this feature would make the business model significantly less than feasible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various dissatisfiers exist within the context of energy management in the Kenyan market, for instance. These include compliance with government regulations, the ability of the client to market their products as produced through efficient energy practices, reduction in wastage, and being able to qualify for the regulator\u2019s compliance certificate. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last dissatisfier (compliance certificate) could also be eligible as a satisfier depending on contract agreements between the client and energy management firm, but that will form part of the next article in this series. Still, the two most significant dissatisfiers with regards to energy management remain a reduction in consumption and a reduction in carbon footprint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dissatisfiers in the energy management space have the potential to have far-reaching consequences not just for energy management companies, but for society as a whole. At this point, it is essential to note that energy management companies are among entities at the forefront in the drive to reduce the effect human activity has on the planet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/ND-L7olN-cliSoaf_xl3cHCfKwxPfbW0JTIPhehhn2EcbJMlTTweY9X1VQW1viaFtFROjr_LL67YJxGCrFaCKGYZWlSBwJOSgjEb0vsC23fi-ei19-gN4dtnNOm27ojrBuPhMcCm7JRDsjqyLg\" alt=\"G:\\__High as a kite\\RS18613_Daniel Cooper_260 (Image_wide_high).jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their recommendations are, at the very least, incrementally working towards reducing man\u2019s carbon footprint. Dissatisfiers have the potential to stop these efforts. This assertion draws from the fact that policy development approaches energy management and climate change from a highly disadvantaged and thus significantly lenient position.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, the responsibility to ensure the viability and sustainability of the business model rests on energy management firms. The implication is that these companies have to work a little harder to ensure clients and potential clients see the immediate value of what energy management firms offer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/bMzPIxz7tSXWzoj7K8niMnRCsSTaXoehqwlVniSaZu_WQ5VzxLd0qjIYg2CANzO7ix7jCVZ_0fzq_pyRMGpwfKJPGAVLOQ_Si7_YghwUh9l2seHeUYGth9vfVUxAf7xlNG2PUdkfcbfI2i_bFg\" alt=\"G:\\__High as a kite\\1946.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bigger picture still exists, that is a reduction in man\u2019s carbon footprint. However, clients will always prefer immediate returns over the greater good. It\u2019s not their fault, that\u2019s just how business works. This assertion shows precisely where the Eenovators Eagles program comes in. This program embodies what the energy space needs to do to remain relevant with one eye on the bigger picture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, the Energy space needs innovative solutions to remain relevant. A perfect scenario would have policymakers create strict guidelines that have energy management companies\u2019 focus remain on the greater good and not have to work harder to stay relevant, but that may not be the case for a long time. For now, the Eenovators Eagles program is the answer the energy space desperately needs.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-1391516384\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Martin Ochieng The energy management space is rapidly expanding.
