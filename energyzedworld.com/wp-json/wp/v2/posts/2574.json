Imagine a project in progress\u00a0 and think of the many things that can go wrong e.g late deliveries, curfews, cessation of movement like the one we are experiencing in Nairobi, Mombasa, etc. Once this is done, you need to put down all identified risks in a risk register.<\/li><li><strong>Analyze the risk<\/strong>&#8211; At this point you have a risk register; so what are you going to do about these risks? You need to determine the likelihood of these risks happening . This information needs to be included on the risk register. Analyzing risk is hard. There is never enough information you can gather. Of course,\u00a0plenty\u00a0of that data is complex, but most industries have best practices,\u00a0which might facilitate you along with your\u00a0analysis.\u00a0You would possibly\u00a0be surprised\u00a0to get\u00a0that your company already\u00a0has a\u00a0framework for this process.<\/li><li><strong>Prioritize the risk<\/strong>&#8211; After the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the risks, you will establish that all risk are not equal. Some will take more resources than others should they occur. At this point you need to categorize your risks as being high, medium or low. Some risks are going to require immediate attention. These are the risks\u00a0which will\u00a0derail your project. Failure isn\u2019t an option. Then there are those risks that have little to no impact on\u00a0the\u00a0project\u2019s schedule and budget.\u00a0A number of\u00a0these low-priority risks\u00a0may be\u00a0important, but not enough to waste time on\u00a0and might\u00a0be somewhat ignored.<\/li><li><strong>Assign an owner to the risk<\/strong>&#8211; Identify the person who is responsible for that risk, identifying it when and if it should occur and then leading the work towards resolving it. There\u00a0may be\u00a0a team member who is more skilled or experienced\u00a0within the\u00a0risk. Then that person should lead the charge to resolve it. Or it might just be an arbitrary choice.<\/li><li><strong>Respond to the risk<\/strong>&#8211; First you need to know if this is a positive or negative risk. Is it something\u00a0you may\u00a0exploit for the betterment of the project? Strategies to manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences) typically include avoiding the threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or\u00a0a part of\u00a0the threat\u00a0to a different\u00a0party, and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of\u00a0a specific\u00a0threat. The opposite of these strategies can be used to respond to opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits). You then act on the risk in order of priority.<\/li><li><strong>Monitor\u00a0the risk<\/strong>&#8211; After responding to the risk,\u00a0you would like to stay\u00a0check if the plan\u00a0is functioning. Whoever is in charge of the risk will be one to track its progress towards resolution.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we must underline that during such situations, as in every period of adversity, changes in the market bring a lot of risks, but they can also create new business opportunities and drive innovation in businesses and sectors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital media &amp; home entertainment, as well as social media companies, are already seeing an uplift in revenues, as an increasing number of consumers opt for solutions that allow them to continue enjoying their hobbies and communicate with others, all from the comfort of their home. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the sooner a company detects the potential threats posed by the corona virus crisis or any other risk and organizes a robust defense and response plan, the greater the possibilities of\u00a0overcoming this crisis with the minimum possible losses, adapting to the new context,\u00a0and recognizing new areas of\u00a0endeavor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">References<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.projectmanager.com\/blog\/risk-management-process-stepshttps:\/\/www.ey.com\/en_gr\/covid-19\/how-can-business-cope-with-covid-19-\">https:\/\/www.projectmanager.com\/blog\/risk-management-process-steps<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.projectmanager.com\/blog\/risk-management-process-stepshttps:\/\/www.ey.com\/en_gr\/covid-19\/how-can-business-cope-with-covid-19-\">https:\/\/www.ey.com\/en_gr\/covid-19\/how-can-business-cope-with-covid-19-<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"energ-after-content\" id=\"energ-4203508067\"><script async src=\"\/\/pagead2.googlesyndication.com\/pagead\/js\/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4467099352079704\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><\/script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px;\" \ndata-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4467099352079704\" \ndata-ad-slot=\"8891238828\"><\/ins> \n<script> \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n<\/script>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Monica Ngage The dramatic spread of COVID-19 has disrupted lives, livelihoods, communities and businesses worldwide.\u00a0it&#8217;s\u00a0been estimated that, if the corona virus spreads uncontrollably, it could\u00a0all right\u00a0cost\u00a0the world\u00a0economy somewhere around $2.7 trillion.
