					<description><![CDATA[Your story is a copy-paste of mine. I am currently in my third year and I can&#039;t explain to people what I will do after I am done with this course. Every time when asked, I always reply with &quot;Renewable energy&quot; or &quot;Solar engineering&quot; so that I can be left alone and not be bothered with subsequent questions.

Anyway, I am glad that I have known that I am not alone in this journey and there are many others that have gone through the same only to meet the light at the end of this dark tunnel. Thank you for your blog and thank you for being an inspiration to me. Perhaps, I would really love to be your mentee in this field. My passion is in Solar energy and renewable energy in general.

How can I contact you?]]></description>
